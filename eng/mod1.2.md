# "Relativity" by Sarah Howe

## Overview
"Relativity" is a sonnet by British poet Sarah Howe, first published in 2015 for the United Kingdom’s National Poetry Day, themed "light." Dedicated to physicist Stephen Hawking, the poem bridges poetry and science, drawing inspiration from Einstein’s theory of relativity and Hawking’s work on black holes. Written during Howe’s tenure as a Research Fellow at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge—where Hawking was also a fellow—the poem was later recited by Hawking in a film by artist Bridget Smith, enhancing its reach. Howe, born in Hong Kong in 1983 to a Chinese mother and British father, infuses the piece with her fascination for metaphor, a tool she sees as shared between poets and scientists. "Relativity" explores light, time, and the cosmos, reflecting on human perception and the mysteries of the universe.

## Summary
The poem begins with an intimate, visceral scene: waking "brushed by panic in the dark," where "our pupils grope for the shape of things we know." This sets a tone of disorientation and search, mirroring both personal vulnerability and scientific inquiry. Howe then introduces the quantum double-slit experiment, where "photons loosed from slits like greyhounds at the track / reveal light’s doubleness in their cast shadows." The resulting interference pattern—"that stripe a dimmed lab’s wall"—illustrates light’s wave-particle duality, bidding "all certainties goodbye." This scientific marvel transitions into a broader cosmic question: "For what’s sure in a universe that dopplers / away like a siren’s midnight cry?"

The second half shifts to Einstein’s relativity, specifically his thought experiment of a flash of light observed from a moving train: "They say / a flash seen from on and off a hurtling train / will explain why time dilates like a perfect / afternoon." This evokes time dilation, where time slows for a moving observer, a concept Howe likens to a languid, subjective experience. The poem then predicts "black holes where parallel lines will meet," referencing the singularity where space-time curves infinitely, and "whose stark horizon even starlight, bent / in its tracks, can’t resist." It concludes with a hopeful query: "If we can think this far, might not our eyes adjust to the dark?"—suggesting that understanding the universe’s vastness could illuminate even our deepest uncertainties.

## Key Themes
- **Light and Duality**: The poem examines light as both particle and wave, a scientific paradox that reflects life’s ambiguities.
- **Time and Relativity**: Time’s elasticity, from dilation to the timelessness of black holes, parallels human perception and cosmic scale.
- **Science and Poetry**: Howe merges empirical observation with poetic metaphor, showing their shared reliance on imagination.
- **Mystery and Adaptation**: The vast, unknowable universe challenges certainty, yet invites adjustment and resilience.

## Structure and Style
"Relativity" is a 14-line sonnet, adhering loosely to the form with seven couplets rather than the traditional octave-sestet split. This structure evokes Einstein’s train tracks—parallel lines converging impossibly at a black hole. Howe’s enjambment (e.g., "They say / a flash") mimics the flow of thought experiments, while her imagery—"greyhounds at the track," "siren’s midnight cry"—grounds abstract physics in vivid sensation. The language is lyrical yet precise, balancing scientific rigor with emotional resonance. The final rhetorical question shifts from observation to introspection, a hallmark of Howe’s reflective style.

## Poem Text
```
When we wake up brushed by panic in the dark
our pupils grope for the shape of things we know.

Photons loosed from slits like greyhounds at the track
reveal light’s doubleness in their cast shadows

that stripe a dimmed lab’s wall—particles no more—
and with a wave bid all certainties goodbye.

For what’s sure in a universe that dopplers
away like a siren’s midnight cry? They say

a flash seen from on and off a hurtling train
will explain why time dilates like a perfect

afternoon; predicts black holes where parallel lines
will meet, whose stark horizon even starlight, bent

in its tracks, can’t resist. If we can think
this far, might not our eyes adjust to the dark?
```

## Context
Commissioned for National Poetry Day 2015, "Relativity" coincided with the centennial of Einstein’s general relativity (1915). Howe’s inspiration stemmed from her teenage awe at Hawking’s *A Brief History of Time*, which she read alongside science fiction by Asimov and Sagan. Her academic background—English at Cambridge, a PhD in Renaissance literature, and fellowships at Harvard’s Radcliffe Institute—shapes her interdisciplinary approach. The poem’s collaboration with Hawking, who recorded it in his synthesized voice, and Smith, who paired it with visuals of graphite particles, underscores its fusion of art and science. Howe’s heritage and global perspective subtly inform her cosmic curiosity.

## Significance
"Relativity" exemplifies Howe’s reputation as a poet of linguistic and thematic depth, earning her the 2015 Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year award alongside her debut collection *Loop of Jade*. The poem’s recitation by Hawking for National Poetry Day amplified its cultural impact, bridging literary and scientific communities. It’s a testament to poetry’s power to distill complex ideas—here, relativity’s counterintuitive truths—into accessible, emotive art. Widely anthologized and discussed, it remains a touchstone for exploring the intersections of human experience and the universe.

## Key Elements
- **Dedication**: To Stephen Hawking, reflecting his influence on Howe’s imagination.
- **Imagery**: Scientific (photons, slits, black holes) and sensory (panic, siren, afternoon).
- **Allusions**: Quantum physics (double-slit experiment), relativity (train, time dilation), and cosmology (black holes).
- **Form**: Sonnet as a "black hole," compressing vastness into 14 lines.
