### Introduction to the Poem
"Pi" is a poem by the Nobel Prize-winning Polish poet Wisława Szymborska, translated into English by Joanna Trzeciak. It reflects on the mathematical constant pi (π), highlighting its infinite and boundless nature through poetic language.

### Poem Text
Here is the full text of "Pi," translated by Joanna Trzeciak:

```
The admirable number pi:
three point one four one.
All the following digits are also initial,
five nine two because it never ends.
It can't be comprehended six five three five at a glance,
eight nine by calculation,
seven nine or imagination,
not even three two three eight by wit, that is, by comparison
four six to anything else
two six four three in the world.
The longest snake on earth calls it quits at about forty feet.
Likewise, snakes of myth and legend, though they may hold out a bit longer.
The pageant of digits comprising the number pi
doesn't stop at the page's edge.
It goes on across the table, through the air,
over a wall, a leaf, a bird's nest, clouds, straight into the sky,
through all the bottomless, bloated heavens.
Oh how brief - a mouse tail, a pigtail - is the tail of a comet!
How feeble the star's ray, bent by bumping up against space!
While here we have two three fifteen three hundred nineteen
my phone number your shirt size the year
nineteen hundred and seventy-three the sixth floor
the number of inhabitants sixty-five cents
hip measurement two fingers a charade, a code,
in which we find hail to thee, blithe spirit, bird thou never wert
alongside ladies and gentlemen, no cause for alarm,
as well as heaven and earth shall pass away,
but not the number pi, oh no, nothing doing,
it keeps right on with its rather remarkable five,
its uncommonly fine eight,
its far from final seven,
nudging, always nudging a sluggish eternity
to continue.
```

### Analysis and Context
The poem likely celebrates pi's infinite decimal expansion, contrasting it with finite earthly measures like the length of snakes or comets. It uses everyday numbers to suggest pi's connection to human life, and literary references to add depth, emphasizing pi's eternal nature.

### Notes on "Pi" by Wisława Szymborska

#### Introduction to Wisława Szymborska

Wisława Szymborska, born on July 2, 1923, in Prowent (now part of Kórnik), Poland, and passing on February 1, 2012, was a distinguished Polish poet. She won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1996, recognized for poetry that with ironic precision illuminates historical and biological contexts within fragments of human reality. Her work, often dealing with everyday subjects and philosophical themes, has been widely translated, making her a significant figure in global literature. She began writing poetry as a child, encouraged by her father, and settled in Krakow by 1931, where she lived until her death.

This translation captures the playful and profound tone, reflecting Szymborska's style of blending the scientific with the poetic.

#### Detailed Analysis of "Pi"

The poem "Pi" explores the infinite nature of the mathematical constant pi, using it as a metaphor for the boundless and the eternal. It begins by listing the initial digits—3.1415926535—and emphasizes that pi "never ends," highlighting its irrational, non-repeating decimal expansion. This is contrasted with finite physical entities, such as the longest snake on earth, which is limited to about forty feet, and mythical snakes, which, though longer, are still finite, as noted in the poem.

Szymborska employs vivid imagery to describe pi's digits as a "pageant" that "doesn't stop at the page's edge," extending across tables, through the air, over walls, and into the sky, symbolizing its infinite reach. This is further emphasized by contrasting pi with the brevity of a comet's tail or a star's ray, described as "feeble" and "bent by bumping up against space," underscoring the vast difference between the finite and the infinite.

The poem intersperses everyday numbers—such as phone numbers, shirt sizes, the year 1973, floor numbers, and measurements like sixty-five cents or hip measurement—within the sequence of pi's digits. This suggests that within the infinite, there are fragments that correspond to meaningful aspects of human life, blending the mathematical with the mundane and highlighting their interconnectedness.

Literary references enrich the poem, such as the line "hail to thee, blithe spirit, bird thou never wert," which echoes Percy Bysshe Shelley's "To a Skylark," adding a layer of poetic wonder to the mathematical theme. The phrase "heaven and earth shall pass away, but not the number pi" parallels the biblical "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away," emphasizing pi's eternal nature and its transcendence over transient physical realities.

The conclusion personifies pi, with its "rather remarkable five, its uncommonly fine eight, its far from final seven," as persistently "nudging, always nudging a sluggish eternity to continue." This suggests pi, with its infinite digits, drives the progression of time or the universe, metaphorically pushing eternity forward.

#### Context and Significance

"Pi" is included in Szymborska's collection "Map: Collected and Last Poems," published and available for purchase at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Map-Collected-Poems-Wislawa-Szymborska/dp/0544126025/) or through public libraries via [WorldCat](http://www.worldcat.org/title/map-collected-and-last-poems/oclc/905854476&referer=brief_results). This collection underscores her engagement with scientific concepts, reflecting her broader interest in how such ideas connect to human experiences and philosophical inquiries. The poem invites readers to contemplate the limits of human understanding, using pi's infinity as a symbol for the awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe, aligning with her Nobel recognition for poetry that illuminates historical and biological contexts.

Commentary from The Marginalian, published on October 23, 2017, describes "Pi" as an ode to mathematics, the most precise language of the universe, using poetry as the most precise language on Earth. It notes pi as a reminder that our maps of reality are incomplete, always leaving more to fathom, due to the same forces that shaped the universe and our tools for understanding it. This analysis situates the poem within Szymborska's oeuvre, emphasizing its philosophical depth and connection to themes of uncertainty and wonder.

#### Additional Notes on Reception and Comments

The poem has received various reader comments, as seen on PoemHunter, with ratings and discussions. For instance, a comment from August 20, 2016, by Laurie Van Der Hart, wonders about pi's endlessness, saying, "I wonder Why, oh why, oh why Pi is as endless as the sky? My son learned it up to its 300th digit I wonder How, oh how, oh how On earth he ever did it!" Another from January 30, 2016, by Susan Williams, notes, "Had me smiling and admiring her adroit use of her skillful pen," reflecting its educational and humorous appeal.
