# On Earth as in the Heavens

### Key Points
- Research suggests that "On Earth as in the Heavens" by Neil deGrasse Tyson is an essay published in *Natural History Magazine* in November 2000, focusing on the universality of physical laws.
- It seems likely that the essay discusses how Isaac Newton's law of gravitation unified earthly and celestial phenomena, showing the same laws apply everywhere.
- The evidence leans toward the essay being included in Tyson's book *Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries* (2007), as Chapter 2, with details on historical physics and universal laws.

### Overview
Neil deGrasse Tyson's essay "On Earth as in the Heavens" explores the idea that the laws of physics are universal, applying both on Earth and throughout the cosmos. This concept, revolutionary in its time, is central to modern science.

### Historical Context
Before Isaac Newton, there was a belief that Earth and the heavens operated under different rules, with the heavens seen as perfect and beyond human understanding, rooted in philosophical and theological views.

### Newton's Contribution
Newton's universal law of gravitation showed that the force pulling apples to the ground also governs the Moon's orbit and planetary motion, unifying our understanding of the universe.

### Implications
This universality allows scientists to study distant celestial objects using Earth-based experiments, forming the basis for astrophysics and cosmology, and potentially serving as a universal language for extraterrestrial communication.

### Notes on "On Earth as in the Heavens" by Neil deGrasse Tyson

#### Introduction
In his essay "On Earth as in the Heavens," published in *Natural History Magazine* in November 2000, Neil deGrasse Tyson explores the profound idea that the laws of physics are universal, governing both terrestrial and celestial phenomena. This concept, which might seem obvious today, was a revolutionary breakthrough in the history of science and is detailed in Chapter 2 of his 2007 book *Death by Black Hole: And Other Cosmic Quandaries* ([Death by Black Hole table of contents](https://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip0616/2006022058.html)). The essay highlights how this understanding has shaped our comprehension of the cosmos.

#### Historical Context
Prior to the scientific revolution, there was a prevailing belief that the laws governing Earth were distinct from those governing the heavens. The heavens were considered perfect and immutable, beyond the comprehension of human minds. This dichotomy was deeply rooted in philosophical and theological thought of the time, as evidenced by Tyson's discussion in the essay, where he notes, "Until Isaac Newton wrote down the universal law of gravitation, there was little reason to presume that the laws of physics on Earth were the same as everywhere else in the universe" ([On Earth As in the Heavens - Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://neildegrassetyson.com/essays/2000-11-on-earth-as-in-the-heavens/)).

#### Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation
Isaac Newton's formulation of the universal law of gravitation marked a turning point. Newton demonstrated that the force causing an apple to fall to the ground is the same force that keeps the Moon in orbit around Earth and the planets around the Sun. This law elegantly unified the understanding of motion across the cosmos, showing that the same physical principles apply everywhere. Tyson elaborates, stating, "Newton had figured out that the force of gravity pulling ripe apples from their branches also guides tossed objects along their curved trajectories and directs the Moon in its orbit around Earth. Newton’s law of gravity also guides planets, asteroids, and comets in their orbits around the Sun and keeps hundreds of billions of stars in orbit within our Milky Way galaxy" ([On Earth As in the Heavens - Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://neildegrassetyson.com/essays/2000-11-on-earth-as-in-the-heavens/)).

#### Examples of Universal Laws
The essay provides various examples to illustrate the universality of physical laws, likely including:

- **Gravity**: From the fall of objects on Earth to the orbits of planets, moons, and stars within galaxies, as seen in Tyson's discussion of celestial mechanics.
- **Electromagnetism**: The behavior of light and electromagnetic waves is consistent throughout the universe, a point that aligns with Tyson's broader work on cosmic phenomena.
- **Thermodynamics**: Laws of energy conservation and entropy apply universally, supporting the essay's theme of universal physical principles.
- **Quantum Mechanics**: Governing atomic and subatomic particles everywhere, though not explicitly detailed in available excerpts, it fits the essay's scope based on Tyson's known interests.

These examples are inferred from the essay's focus on universality, as seen in discussions of spectral analysis and constants like the speed of light, mentioned in related reviews ([‘Death by Black Hole’ by Neil deGrasse Tyson | astrobiologysociety.org](https://astrobiologysociety.org/death-by-black-hole-by-neil-degrasse-tyson/)).

#### Implications for Science
The recognition that physical laws are universal has profound implications for science, as outlined in the essay. It allows scientists to apply knowledge gained from Earth-based experiments to understand distant celestial objects, forming the basis for astrophysics and cosmology. This principle enables the study of the universe's structure, evolution, and composition, and provides a framework for predicting and explaining phenomena across vast distances and time scales. Tyson's work, including this essay, underscores how this universality is fundamental to scientific progress, as noted in Wikipedia's summary of the chapter addressing the history of physics and its application to the sun and other planets ([Death by Black Hole - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_by_Black_Hole)).

#### Science as a Universal Language
Tyson discusses how the universality of science could facilitate communication with extraterrestrial intelligence. The messages carried by the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft include scientific information about our solar system and the structure of atoms, based on the assumption that any advanced civilization would understand these fundamental principles. For instance, the Pioneer plaque shows the layout of our solar system and the structure of the hydrogen atom, while Voyager includes sounds from Earth, such as the human heartbeat and whale songs, assuming aliens might appreciate or understand them. This is evident in the essay's later sections, where Tyson mentions, "Such an attempt was made in the 1970s with the Pioneer 10 and 11 and Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft, the only ones given a great enough speed to escape the solar system’s gravitational pull. Pioneer donned a golden etched plaque that showed, in scientific pictograms, the layout of our solar system, our location in the Milky Way galaxy, and the structure of the hydrogen atom. Voyager went further and also included diverse sounds from mother Earth including the sound of the human heartbeat, whale ‘songs,’ and musical selections ranging from the works of Beethoven to Chuck Berry" ([On Earth As in the Heavens - Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://neildegrassetyson.com/essays/2000-11-on-earth-as-in-the-heavens/)).

#### Conclusion
The essay underscores the importance of recognizing that the laws of physics are the same everywhere in the universe. This understanding has been crucial for the advancement of science and our comprehension of the cosmos, as detailed in Tyson's narrative. The essay's inclusion in *Death by Black Hole* further emphasizes its significance, providing a comprehensive look at how universal laws shape our view of the universe.
