# Wonders of Science: Printed Version of Albert Einstein's 1930 Berlin Speech

## About the Speaker
Albert Einstein, the German-born visionary scientist, is most renowned for his ground-breaking theory of Relativity, which revolutionized the world of space, time, and gravity. His formula \( e=mc^2 \), the equivalence of mass and energy, has become one of the most recognizable symbols in science. Far beyond Relativity, Einstein's Photoelectric effect laid foundations for the understanding of the Quantum world and received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. In 1895, Einstein moved to Switzerland and in 1905 submitted his PhD dissertation to the University of Zurich. In 1909, he became the Professor Extraordinary at Zurich and later was appointed the Director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Institute and Professor in the University of Berlin. As a child, he wrote about two wonders that deeply affected his early years: the first, his encounter with a compass at the age of five. Mystified with the invisible forces that could deflect the needle led to a lifelong fascination with invisible forces. He wrote about the second wonder at the age of twelve, when he discovered a book of geometry, calling it 'a sacred little geometry book'. Einstein's life was marked.

Ladies and Gentlemen who are present and who are not!

When you hear the radio, think also about the fact of how people have come to possess such a wonderful tool of communication. The origin of all technical achievements is the divine curiosity and the play instinct of the working and thinking researcher, as well as the constructive fantasy of the technical inventor.

Think of Oersted, who as the first person noticed the magnetic effect of electric currents; of Reis, who as the first one made use of this effect to generate sound by using electromagnetism; of Bell, who as the first person converted sound waves into variable electric currents with his microphone by using sensitive contacts. Think also of Maxwell, who showed us the existence of electric waves by using a mathematical way; of Hertz, who as the first person generated them with the help of a spark and thus proved them. Think especially of Lieben, who invented an unprecedented measuring instrument for electric pulses, the electric valve tube. It was also an ideal and simple instrument to generate electric waves. Think gratefully of the big number of unknown engineers who simplified the instruments of communication via radio and adapted them to mass production in such a fashion that they have become ready to be used by everybody nowadays.

And everybody should be ashamed who uses the wonders of science and engineering without thinking and having mentally realized not more of it than a cow realizes of the botany of the plants which it eats with pleasure.

Think also about the fact that it is the engineers who make true democracy possible. They facilitate not only...

## Outline of the Text
Einstein's 1930 speech delivered in Berlin at the opening of the Seventh German Radio Exhibition, marked with poise and terse, is a profound reflection on the relationship between science and humanity. Celebrating the marvels of technology, Einstein emphasized the importance of scientific inquiry in shaping the world. Acknowledging the awe-inspiring discovery of radio to connect people across the world, he traced the origins of these technological wonders to the 'divine curiosity' and 'play instinct' of inventors to explore the world. Sketching the glorious contributions of Oersted, Reis, Bell, Maxwell, and Hertz for laying the foundation for modern communication technology, Einstein exhorted individuals to embrace science prudently for the well-being of humans. He hailed engineers for their contribution to democracy by facilitating daily work with ease and considered technological advancement as a fruit of centuries of scientific exploration driven by the ingenuity of countless individuals. He called for a perfect harnessing of the power of science for the benefit of mankind. Einstein's speech is a powerful reminder of the nexus between science and society, highlighting the generative power of scientific inquiry and the importance of fostering a culture of critical thinking and ethical responsibility.

## Summary
Albert Einstein's 1930 Berlin speech, delivered at the opening of the Seventh German Radio Exhibition, celebrates the transformative impact of scientific inquiry and technological innovation, particularly the invention of radio. He attributes these advancements to the curiosity and ingenuity of inventors like Oersted, Reis, Bell, Maxwell, and Hertz, who laid the groundwork for modern communication. Einstein emphasizes the role of engineers in making technology accessible and fostering democracy, while urging individuals to appreciate and understand the science behind these wonders. His speech also serves as a call for ethical responsibility and critical thinking, reflecting his broader commitment to peace and humanity.
