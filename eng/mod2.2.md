### About the Text
Rosebud Ben-Oni's "All Palaces are Temporary Palaces" is a poignant exploration of the ethereality of the cosmos and the ephemeral nature of existence. Inspired by a conversation with her six-year-old niece and kindled by the child's sense of awe and wonder, the poem delves deep into philosophical questions on mortality. The child's questions about asteroids, quarks, and anti-quarks serve as a catalyst for the poet's contemplation on life. Through the lens of science and sense, Ben-Oni examines the vastness of the cosmos and the fragility of human existence. The title encapsulates the core of the poem: the symbols of power and all magnificent structures perish in the course of time.

## Text
My niece calls with questions of asteroid mining.  
At six she’s worried & can’t tell me why.  
So we talk it out. I hear there is gold, silver, platinum  
On spent comets. Who would say I do on a stony  
Asteroid? People are already getting married  
underwater,  
The very rich driving cars on coral reefs.  
& if the newest frontiers require technology  
Smaller than an atom, well, now there’s the  
pentaquark  
Which is almost all quark save for one  
Antiquark, & if not for the anti-  
Quark, would anything, any-  
Thing at all, be? What’s next is never  
Enough. All left to chance shrinking. My dear, dear girl  
Calling on this overcast day in the spring, where  
sky is one long cover  
Of impassivity. Why are we here? She’s asking for  
the first time,  
& I hear the anxiety of one who’s stumbled upon a  
burning  
Temple in the fields. We listen to each other  
Breathe. I miss my train, linger on a winding  
staircase  
In Woodside, Queens. I remember the day I  
discovered  
This small stretch of exposed track subverting the  
sky & knew  
I’d come home. One more day, & I will tell her this  
One more day for life on asteroids without fences  
or fracking,  
& dreams know no deep inelastic scattering. Let it be  
Where silence is never summoned, where rays  
Collide in charm & strange
