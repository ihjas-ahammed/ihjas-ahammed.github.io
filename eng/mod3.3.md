### Detailed Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of "A Study in Emerald" by Neil Gaiman

#### Introduction and Background
"A Study in Emerald" is a short story authored by Neil Gaiman, a prominent British fantasy and graphic novel writer, first published in 2003 within the anthology "Shadows Over Baker Street." This collection combines the worlds of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and Gaiman's contribution has been notably recognized, winning the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 2004. The story's title alludes to Doyle's "A Study in Scarlet," reflecting its structural and thematic parallels while introducing a Lovecraftian twist. It has since been included in Gaiman's collection "Fragile Things" and is available online, presented as a Victorian periodical, enhancing its immersive quality with advertisements referencing characters like Vlad Tepes and Victor Frankenstein.

#### Plot Summary and Narrative Structure
Set in an alternate Victorian England, referred to as Albion, the story unfolds in a world where the Great Old Ones, eldritch beings from Lovecraft's mythology, have ruled for 700 years following their victory over humanity. The narrative is delivered through the perspective of a war veteran, injured in a conflict against the "gods and men of Afghanistan," who seeks lodgings and becomes roommates with a consulting detective of extraordinary deductive skills. This detective, implied to be Professor James Moriarty, is hired by Inspector Lestrade to solve a murder of national importance: the victim, a German royal with inhuman features, is a nephew of the Queen, one of the Great Old Ones. The Queen heals the narrator's shoulder as payment, highlighting the supernatural elements at play.

The investigation leads to a music hall show starring Sherry Vernet, an actor depicted in a historical narrative of the war, and the detective deduces that Vernet, using the alias "Rache," and a limping man skilled with surgical equipment (implied Dr. John Watson) are involved. They are "Restorationists," anarchists opposing the Great Old Ones' rule, and responsible for the murder. Vernet eludes arrest, leaving a letter detailing the horrors committed by the rulers, which the narrator, implied to be Colonel Sebastian Moran, deposits in a bank vault with an account of events, to be opened posthumously, possibly soon due to recent Russian unrest, potentially referencing the 1881 assassination of Tsar Alexander II.

The story mirrors "A Study in Scarlet" in structure, with a twist ending revealing the detective and narrator as Moriarty and Moran, not Holmes and Watson, supported by details like the detective's paper "The Dynamics of an Asteroid" (authored by Moriarty in Doyle's works) and Moran's marksmanship. This inversion is a key narrative device, subverting reader expectations and enriching the intertextual dialogue.

#### Character Analysis
The characters are presented as analogues to Doyle's and Lovecraft's universes, with identities inferred through clues:
- **The Narrator:** Implied to be Colonel Sebastian Moran, a retired major and skilled marksman, whose military background and signature "S_________ M______" align with Moran's profile in Doyle's stories.
- **The Detective:** Implied to be Professor James Moriarty, known for his intellectual prowess and authorship of "The Dynamics of an Asteroid," a reference to his characterization as a criminal mastermind in "The Final Problem."
- **Sherry Vernet:** Implied to be Sherlock Holmes, with "Vernet" referencing Holmes' grandmother in Doyle's canon, and his role as a "Restorationist" inverting his traditional heroic image.
- **The Limping Man:** Implied to be Dr. John Watson, with medical skills and a limp fitting Watson's description, now cast as a co-conspirator in the murder.

This role reversal is central, positioning Moriarty and Moran as protagonists solving a crime committed by Holmes and Watson, who are here antagonists resisting oppressive rule.

#### Themes and Literary Analysis
The story delves into several profound themes:
- **Role Reversal:** It inverts the traditional dynamics of Holmesian narratives, with Moriarty and Moran as the investigators and Holmes and Watson as villains, challenging reader perceptions of morality and heroism.
- **Power and Oppression:** The setting, where Great Old Ones rule, explores the implications of living under tyrannical, eldritch beings, with prosperity juxtaposed against sacrifices and horrors, as detailed in Vernet's letter.
- **Intertextuality:** Gaiman skillfully blends detective fiction with cosmic horror, creating a pastiche that respects both Doyle's deductive reasoning and Lovecraft's atmospheric dread, with subtle allusions like the Queen's healing and the murder scene described as "a study in emerald."
- **Moral Ambiguity:** The narrative questions the ethics of resistance versus collaboration, with Holmes and Watson's actions framed as necessary but violent, and Moriarty and Moran's allegiance to the rulers presented as pragmatic.

Literary techniques enhance these themes:
- **Unreliable Narration:** The gradual revelation of character identities, through clues like the detective's paper and the narrator's marksmanship, adds layers of mystery and surprise, aligning with both Holmesian deduction and Lovecraftian unease.
- **Pastiche:** The story emulates Victorian detective fiction's style, with formal language and periodic structure, while integrating horror through the Great Old Ones' presence and the murder's cosmic implications.
- **World-Building:** Gaiman's alternate history, where the Great Old Ones have ruled for centuries, is detailed through references to historical events and societal norms, creating a rich, immersive backdrop.
