# "Only an Axe Away" by P. Baburaj and C. Saratchandran

## Overview
"Only an Axe Away" is a 2004 documentary film co-directed by P. Baburaj and C. Saratchandran, two prominent Indian activist-filmmakers based in Kerala. Running 40 minutes with English subtitles, the film chronicles the historic environmental campaign to save Silent Valley, a pristine rainforest in Kerala’s Palakkad district, from a proposed hydroelectric dam in the 1970s and 1980s. Produced amid growing ecological awareness in India, it highlights the grassroots resistance led by local communities, scientists, poets, and activists against destructive development. The Silent Valley National Park, declared in 1984, stands as a testament to this victory, though the film also warns of ongoing threats. Combining archival footage, interviews, and narration, "Only an Axe Away" won the Jury Prize at the Mumbai International Film Festival (MIFF) in 2008 and the Jeevan TV Award for Best Documentary, cementing its status as a key work in Indian environmental cinema.

## Summary
The documentary opens by introducing Silent Valley, a biodiversity hotspot in the Western Ghats, home to rare species like the lion-tailed macaque and untouched by human settlement for centuries. It then details the Kerala State Electricity Board’s 1970s plan to build a dam across the Kunthipuzha River, which would have submerged 8.3 square kilometers of forest, displacing wildlife and disrupting ecosystems. The film traces the campaign’s origins to local resistance, sparked by fears of ecological loss and amplified by the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP), a people’s science movement.

Key figures emerge: scientists like M.K. Prasad, who documented the valley’s ecological value, and poets like Sugathakumari, whose "Marathinu Stuthi" ("Ode to a Tree") galvanized public sentiment. The narrative weaves in the voices of tribal communities, notably the Mudugar and Irula, whose livelihoods depended on the forest. Archival clips show protests, public debates, and media coverage, including the involvement of international bodies like the IUCN, which pressured the Indian government after Silent Valley’s global ecological significance was recognized.

The film builds to the campaign’s climax: after years of activism, legal battles, and scientific reports—including a pivotal 1983 study by the M.G.K. Menon committee—Prime Minister Indira Gandhi intervened, halting the project. Silent Valley was declared a National Park on November 15, 1984. Yet, "Only an Axe Away" doesn’t end on triumph alone; it cautions that new threats—like the proposed Pathrakkadavu hydroelectric project in 2004—loom "only an axe away," urging vigilance. The title evokes both the forest’s fragility and the activists’ resolve, symbolized by their readiness to physically shield trees.

## Key Themes
- **Environmental Justice**: The film frames Silent Valley’s preservation as a victory for nature and marginalized communities over profit-driven development.
- **People’s Power**: It celebrates collective action—uniting scientists, poets, and locals—as a model for grassroots resistance.
- **Fragility of Nature**: The ongoing threats underscore the precarious balance between conservation and exploitation.
- **Science and Poetry**: The interplay of empirical evidence and emotional appeals highlights a uniquely Indian approach to activism.

## Directors
- **P. Baburaj**: A Kerala-based filmmaker and activist, Baburaj often collaborated with Saratchandran, blending cinéma vérité with political advocacy. His work focuses on social and environmental struggles.
- **C. Saratchandran (1958–2010)**: An influential documentarian and environmentalist, Saratchandran trained under G. Aravindan and John Abraham. Known for films like *Chaliyar…The Final Struggle*, he died in a train accident in 2010, leaving a legacy of activist cinema.

## Structure and Style
The 40-minute runtime is tightly paced, blending talking-head interviews with activists and locals, grainy archival footage of protests, and lush visuals of Silent Valley’s flora and fauna. Narration provides historical context, while folk music and poetry recitation (e.g., Sugathakumari’s verses) add emotional depth. The filmmakers’ participatory ethos shines through—they were involved in the movement themselves—lending authenticity. The film’s climax juxtaposes the 1984 victory with a sobering coda on future threats, avoiding a simplistic happy ending.

## Context
The Silent Valley Movement (1973–1984) was India’s first major environmental campaign, predating Chipko and Narmada struggles. It unfolded during a post-Emergency period of heightened activism and gained traction amid global conservation trends. Baburaj and Saratchandran, both rooted in Kerala’s radical documentary tradition, made the film two decades later, prompted by renewed dam proposals in 2004. Their prior collaborations—like *The Bitter Drink* (2003) on Plachimada—established their credibility in documenting resistance.

## Significance
"Only an Axe Away" is a landmark in Indian documentary filmmaking, blending historical record with activist urgency. Its 2008 MIFF Jury Prize reflects its craft and impact, while its screenings at festivals like ViBGYOR (co-founded by Saratchandran) amplified its reach. The film educates on Silent Valley’s legacy—India’s only rainforest National Park—and inspires ongoing ecological battles, resonating beyond Kerala.

## Key Elements
- **Archival Footage**: Protests, newsreels, and dam site surveys from the 1970s–1980s.
- **Interviews**: M.K. Prasad, Sugathakumari, and tribal voices provide firsthand accounts.
- **Awards**: Jury Prize, MIFF 2008; Jeevan TV Award for Best Documentary.
- **Symbolism**: The axe as both threat and tool of resistance.

## Quotes
- "The forest was only an axe away from destruction, but so were we from saving it." (Paraphrased from narration.)
- "Silent Valley is not just a place; it’s a symbol of what we can achieve together." (Activist interview.)
- "Marathinu Stuthi" excerpt: "Oh tree, you are my mother, my breath…" (Sugathakumari, recited in film.)
