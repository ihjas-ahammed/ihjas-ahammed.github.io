#### Poem Text and Structure  
The poem, presented in full below, is a narrative told through the personification of numbers, specifically 59, 60, and 61, exploring themes of love, uniqueness, and mathematical properties. It is written in free verse with a conversational tone, suitable for performance, and includes humorous and relatable elements. The full text is as follows:

```
59 wakes up on the wrong side of the bed.  
Realizes all his hair is on one side of his head.  
Takes just under a minute to work out that it’s because of the way that he slept.  
He finds some clothes and gets dressed.  
He can’t help but look in the mirror and be subtly impressed  
How he looks rough around the edges and yet casually messed.  
And as he glances out the window, he sees the sight that he gets blessed with of 60 from across the street.  
Now 60 was beautiful.  
With perfectly trimmed cuticles, dressed in something suitable.  
Never rude or crude at all.  
Unimprovable, right on time as usual, more on cue than a snooker ball but liked to play it super cool.  
59 wanted to tell her that he knew her favorite flower.  
He thought of her every second, every minute, every hour.  
But he knew it wouldn’t work, he’d never get the girl.  
Because although she lived across the street they came from different worlds.  
While 59 admired 60’s perfectly round figure, 60 thought 59 was odd.  
One of his favorite films was "101 Dalmatians."  
She preferred the sequel.  
He romanticized the idea they were star-crossed lovers.  
They could overcome the odds and evens because they had each other.  
While she maintained the strict views imposed on her by her mother  
That separate could not be equal.  
And though at the time he felt stupid and dumb  
For trying to love a girl controlled by her stupid mum,  
He should have been comforted by the simple sum.  
Take 59 away from 60, and you’re left with the one.  
Sure enough after two months of moping around,  
61 days later, 61 was who he found,  
He had lost his keys and his parents were out.  
So one day after school he went into a house  
As he noticed the slightly wonky numbers on the door,  
He wondered why he’d never introduced himself before,  
As she let him in, his jaw dropped in awe.  
61 was like 60, but a little bit more.  
She had prettier eyes, and an approachable smile,  
And like him, rough around the edges, casual style,  
And like him, everything was in disorganized piles,  
And like him, her mum didn’t mind if friends stayed a while.  
Because she was like him, and he liked her.  
He reckoned she would like him if she knew he was like her,  
And it was different this time. I mean, this girl was wicked,  
So he plucked up the courage and asked for her digits.  
She said, "I'm 61." He grinned, said, "I'm 59."  
Today I’ve had a really nice time,  
So tomorrow if you wanted you could come over to mine?  
She said, "Sure."  
She loved talking to someone just as quirky,  
She agreed to this unofficial first date.  
In the end he was only ready one minute early,  
But it didn’t matter because she arrived one minute late.  
And from that moment on there was nonstop chatter,  
How they loved "X Factor," how they had two factors,  
How that did not matter, distinctiveness made them better,  
By the end of the night they knew they were meant together.  
And one day she was talking about stuck-up 60,  
She noticed that 59 looked a bit shifty.  
He blushed, told her of his crush:  
“The best thing that never happened because it led to us.”  
61 was clever, see, not prone to jealousy,  
She looked him in the eyes and told him quite tenderly,  
"You're 59, I’m 61, together we combine to become twice what 60 could ever be."  
At this point 59 had tears in his eyes,  
Was so glad to have this one-of-a-kind girl in his life.  
He told her the very definition of being prime  
Was that with only one and himself could his heart divide,  
And she was the one he wanted to give his heart to,  
She said she felt the same and now she knew the films were half true.  
Because that wasn't real love, that love was just a sample,  
When it came to real love, they were a prime example.
```

#### Themes and Literary Analysis  
The poem explores several key themes:
- **Love and Rejection:** The narrative begins with 59's unrequited love for 60, who is depicted as perfect but unattainable, reflecting the loneliness of prime numbers, which can only be divided by 1 and themselves.
- **Uniqueness and Compatibility:** The shift to 61, another prime number, highlights the idea that true love comes from finding someone with similar quirks, as both 59 and 61 are "rough around the edges" and share common interests like "X Factor."
- **Mathematical Metaphors:** Baker uses mathematical concepts, such as prime numbers and factors, to weave a love story, with lines like "Take 59 away from 60, and you’re left with the one" and "together we combine to become twice what 60 could ever be," emphasizing the poem's mathematical foundation.

The structure is conversational and performative, with rhythmic lines and humorous asides, such as 60 thinking 59 is "odd" (a mathematical pun), making it ideal for slam poetry. The personification of numbers adds a whimsical layer, aligning with Baker's style of blending nerdiness with emotion.

#### Character Analysis  
The poem features three main "characters":
- **59:** Representing a prime number, 59 is depicted as awkward and lonely, initially infatuated with 60 but finding true love with 61. His journey mirrors the isolation of primes, only divisible by 1 and themselves.
- **60:** A composite number, portrayed as beautiful and perfect but elitist, preferring "101 Dalmatians 2" and maintaining strict views, symbolizing unattainable ideals.
- **61:** Another prime, similar to 59 in her imperfections and style, becoming his perfect match, illustrating the compatibility of primes.

This personification allows Baker to explore emotional narratives through mathematical identities, enhancing the poem's appeal to both math enthusiasts and poetry lovers.
