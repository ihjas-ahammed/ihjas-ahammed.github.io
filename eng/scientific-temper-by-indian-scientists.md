#  Scientific  Temper  By  Indian  Scientists

##  Constitution  of  India:  Article  51A

It  shall  be  duty  of  every  citizen  of  India  to  develop,  the  scientific  temper,  humanism  and  spirit  of  inquiry  and  reform.

So  this  is  a  discussion  of  seven  scientists  on  scientific  temper.

##  Dr  Satyajith  Ray

*  Scientific  temper  is  not  an  academic  matter
*  It  is  a  basic  feature  of  us  human  beings.
*  Scientific  temper  is  about  logical  thinking.
*  It's  not  about  whether  we  have  scientific  temper  or  not,  It's  about  why  don't  we  have  it  in  specific  cases.
*  In  some  cases  we  give  up  scientific  temper  and  we  should  ask  why  for  that.
*  Like  we're  not  supposed  to  cross  the  roads  without  looking  two  sides  and  farmers  don't  plant  crops  and  April.

##  Dr  Surendra  Ghaskhavi

*  Scientific  temper  is  basically  asking  questions.
*  If  question  is  intresting,  then  definition  your  answer  will  be  intresting.
*  When  and  whenever  you  get  new  data,  you  should  be  prepared  to  accept  it.
*  Therefore  unlike  probably  other  areas,  it  gets  to  revised  very  fast.
*  We're  not  open  to  correction  in  most  human  factors.

##  Radha  Chauhan

*  She  says  that  to  have  scientific  temper  you  must  have  to  learn  how  to  rationalize  everything.
*  Every  answer  you  get  by  rationally  thinking  is  science.

##    Praveen  Rahi

*  Science  is  about  asking  question  and  logically  finding  reasonable  answers.
*  You  can  apply  modern  technology  to  find  the  answer.

##  Deepa  Subrahmanan

*  People  don't  knew  that  scientific  temper  is  in  all  of  us.
*  For  a  proper  scientist,  he  must  have  an  encouragement  from  people  around.
*  Without  curiosity  none  of  this  matters.

##  Sunil  Saroj

*  He  talks  about  importance  of  being  a  good  observer.
*  An  observer  can  only  have  curiosity.

##  Dr  Amit  Yadev

*  It  doesn't  come  overnight
*  It  is  not  a  gift  that  you  are  born  with.
*  It  is  about  asking  questions  yourself  and  also  to  others.
