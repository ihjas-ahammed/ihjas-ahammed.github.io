"The Fourth State of Matter" by Jo Ann Beard

## Overview
"The Fourth State of Matter" is a creative nonfiction essay by Jo Ann Beard, first published in *The New Yorker* on June 24, 1996, and later included in her collection *The Boys of My Youth* (1998). This braided essay masterfully intertwines multiple narrative strands—personal loss, an aging pet, and a tragic workplace shooting—to explore themes of grief, isolation, and the fragility of life. Set against the backdrop of Beard's life in Iowa in 1991, the essay captures a week when her world unravels, culminating in the University of Iowa shooting perpetrated by Gang Lu, a disgruntled physics graduate student. Beard, who worked as the managing editor of a space physics journal at the university, uses her personal experiences to frame the devastating event, creating a poignant meditation on loss and resilience.

## Summary
The essay opens with Beard describing her aging collie, who wakes her multiple times each night to go outside. This routine introduces a sense of quiet domesticity and foreshadows the theme of impending loss. Beard, in her late 30s, is navigating a crumbling marriage—her husband has recently left her, moving into a "dank little apartment" across town, yet he continues to call, leaving conflicted messages on her answering machine. Meanwhile, squirrels have invaded her spare bedroom, adding chaos to her already unsettled life. She calls her friend Caroline, a former beauty queen turned animal enthusiast, to remove them, a scene that highlights her reluctance to confront her problems directly.

At work, Beard manages the journal alongside Christoph "Chris" Goertz, a hip, professorial physicist with whom she shares a warm, collegial bond. Chris, obsessed with the dust in Saturn's ring plasma, introduces the concept of plasma—the fourth state of matter (after solid, liquid, and gas)—which becomes a metaphor woven throughout the essay. Other colleagues, like the pipe-smoking Bob Smith and the department head Dwight Nicholson, populate her workplace, a space she finds soothing amid her personal turmoil. Beard also notes gifts Chris has brought her from his travels—a bronze box from Africa, amber from Poland, and elephant-hide bracelets—symbols of their friendship.

The narrative shifts abruptly when Beard, having left work early on Friday, November 1, 1991, to care for her collie, learns of a shooting at the physics department. Gang Lu, a graduate student frustrated with his academic prospects, opens fire during a theoretical-plasma-physics meeting, killing Chris, Linhua Shan, Bob Smith, Dwight Nicholson, and administrator Anne Cleary. The student receptionist, Miya Rodolfo-Sioson, survives but is paralyzed, and Lu then takes his own life. Beard receives fragmented news from coworkers and Chris’s wife, grappling with disbelief and shock as the reality unfolds. At home, surrounded by friends like Mary, she smokes cigarettes, drinks whiskey, and stares at herself in the mirror, noting she’s still "Jo Ann, white face and dark hair," despite the upheaval.

The essay closes with Beard reflecting on the silence left by the departed—her husband, the squirrels (now gone), and her colleagues. Her collie, nearing death, remains her constant companion. The final lines evoke the "plasmapause," a cosmic equilibrium where "the particles of dust stop spinning and hang motionless in deep space," paralleling her emotional stasis amid cascading losses.

## Key Themes
- **Grief and Loss**: The essay braids Beard’s personal losses (her marriage, her dog, her colleagues) into a tapestry of mourning, showing how grief accumulates and intersects.
- **Control and Chaos**: Beard’s lack of control over her marriage, the squirrels, and the shooting mirrors the unpredictable nature of plasma, a state of matter that resists containment.
- **Connection**: Relationships—with her collie, Chris, and even her absent husband—anchor Beard, yet their fragility underscores life’s impermanence.
- **Science as Metaphor**: Plasma, the fourth state of matter, symbolizes the chaotic, uncontainable forces in Beard’s life, linking her personal narrative to the cosmic research of her colleagues.

## Characters
- **Jo Ann Beard**: The narrator, a writer and editor facing personal and professional upheaval.
- **The Collie**: Beard’s unnamed, elderly dog, a symbol of loyalty and impending loss.
- **The Husband**: An unnamed figure who has left Beard, oscillating between regret and independence.
- **Chris Goertz**: Beard’s supportive colleague and friend, the first victim of the shooting.
- **Gang Lu**: The shooter, a physics student whose rage shatters the department.
- **Caroline**: Beard’s friend who removes the squirrels, offering a moment of levity.
- **Other Victims**: Linhua Shan, Bob Smith, Dwight Nicholson, Anne Cleary, and Miya Rodolfo-Sioson, whose lives are altered or ended by the tragedy.
- **Mary**: A coworker who supports Beard post-shooting.

## Structure and Style
Beard employs a braided structure, weaving three narrative threads—the collie, her marriage, and the shooting—into a cohesive whole. Her prose is lyrical yet precise, balancing mundane details (cigarettes, coffee, chalk drawings) with profound reflections. The present tense creates immediacy, immersing readers in her unfolding reality, while recurring motifs—like the chalkboard, plasma, and the night sky—tie the strands together. The essay’s pacing builds tension, delaying the shooting’s revelation to mirror Beard’s own unawareness, culminating in a quiet, haunting resolution.

## Context
The essay is rooted in the real-life University of Iowa shooting on November 1, 1991, where Gang Lu killed five people and injured one before committing suicide. Beard’s role as an editor in the physics department lends authenticity, though she takes creative liberties (e.g., imagined dialogue) typical of creative nonfiction. Published in 1996, the piece predates the modern ubiquity of mass shootings, offering a historical lens on gun violence in America.

## Significance
"The Fourth State of Matter" is celebrated for its emotional depth and craft, earning acclaim in *Best American Essays 1997* and cementing Beard’s reputation as a master essayist. It’s a touchstone in creative nonfiction, taught widely for its narrative complexity and ability to transform tragedy into art. The essay resonates universally through its exploration of loss, making it timeless despite its specific historical anchor.

## Quotes
- "The collie wakes me up about three times a night, summoning me from a great distance as I row my boat through a dim, complicated dream."
- "Plasma is the fourth state of matter. You’ve got your solid, your liquid, your gas, and then your plasma."
- "In a few hours the world will resume itself, but for now we’re in a pocket of silence. We’re in the plasmapause, a place of equilibrium."

## Content Warning
The essay includes depictions of gun violence, suicide, and animal decline, which may be distressing to some readers.
