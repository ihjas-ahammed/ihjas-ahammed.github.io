Absolutely! Here's the translation of the Arabic text into English:

**Unit: 7**

**Friendship and Tolerance**

**Friendship:**

**Teacher:** What is friendship, Ali?

**Ali:** A friend is someone who knows all your secrets, wishes you well, and tells you everything they feel. The relationship between you and them is based on affection and intimacy.

**Teacher:** Who is a good friend, Ali?

**Ali:** A good friend is someone who encourages you to do good deeds, get closer to God, cares about you, and doesn't envy you.

**Teacher:** What did our Prophet say about choosing a friend?

**Ali:** The Prophet, peace be upon him, said: "A person is on the religion of his close friend, so let each of you look at whom he takes as a friend."

**Teacher:** May God bless you, my son.

**Tolerance:**

**Mona:** Mom, can we talk about tolerance?

**Mother:** Of course, my daughter. Tolerance is forgiveness when you are capable of punishing, and not repaying evil with evil. It is a moral concept that all messengers and prophets called for.

**Mona:** What is the benefit of tolerance, Mom?

**Mother:** Tolerance, my daughter, helps to achieve unity and cohesion among societies and eliminate disputes. It also means respecting the culture, beliefs, values, and opinions of others, and giving up our desire to harm them.

**Mona:** What is the reason for the absence of this noble quality at the present time?

**Mother:** I think, my daughter, that the main reason is the lack of commitment to good morals and the Prophetic approach that urges us to be tolerant and have mutual respect with people, no matter how different they are, because tolerance is what makes us human in the end.

**Mona:** Thank you, Mom. I have benefited a lot from talking to you.
