# Introduction to Machine Learning

**Artificial Intelligence:** It’s about getting machines to handle tasks that people are typically great at, like thinking, problem-solving, or recognizing patterns, but designing them to assist or even outperform humans in these areas over time.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

# What is Machine Learning?

- It’s the process of enabling a system to boost its performance by learning from past experiences or data, getting smarter as it goes.

* Systems aim to minimize errors and improve precision over time through learning.

## Goals:
- Boost their performance (P) on a specific task (T) by gaining experience (E).

## Well-defined Learning Task
- Defined by the combination of performance measure (P), task (T), and experience (E), like <P, T, E>.

## Notes:
- Systems don’t always require human intervention... (incomplete note)
- ...stateless processes have been adapted for batch processing in some cases...

## Programming vs Learning
- **Traditional Programming:** You write rules (e.g., "if x > 5, output y"), and the computer follows them to produce an output.
- **Machine Learning:** You feed data (e.g., examples of x and y pairs), and the system figures out the rules to predict or generate outputs on its own.

# Teaching a Machine - Continuous Inputs

- It involves constantly providing a machine with input data and expected outputs, allowing it to adjust and create a model or program that matches those expectations, like training it to predict weather based on historical data.

## When to Use Machine Learning?

- When a human expert is available but their knowledge can be captured and automated.
- When no human expertise exists, and the system needs to discover patterns from scratch.
- When humans can’t clearly explain their expertise, like recognizing faces or diagnosing diseases intuitively.

## Applications:
- **Personalized Medicine:** Tailoring treatments to individual patients using their genetic and health data.
- **Genomics:** Analyzing DNA sequences to identify genetic markers or predict disease risks.

# Classification

## Types of Learning:
1. **Supervised Learning:** The machine learns from labeled data (e.g., spam vs. not spam emails) to make predictions or classify new data.
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** The machine finds patterns in unlabeled data, like grouping customers by shopping habits without prior categories.
3. **Semi-supervised Learning:** Combines a small amount of labeled data with a lot of unlabeled data to improve learning efficiency.
4. **Reinforcement Learning:** The machine learns by trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties (e.g., a robot learning to navigate a maze by maximizing rewards).

## Supervised Learning
- **Classification:** Predicting discrete labels, like identifying whether an email is spam or not.
- **Regression:** Predicting continuous values, like forecasting house prices based on size and location.
