# 6. Data Cleaning in Python (Practical)

1.  Using Python's Pandas library, show how to replace specific incorrect string values (typos) in a DataFrame column named `'column_name'` with their correct counterparts.  Provide a code example.  (Assume `mutible` should be `immutable`, and `erro` should be `error`.) (3 marks)
2.  Show how to use scikit-learn's `SimpleImputer` to impute missing values in a DataFrame column named `'column_name'` using the *mean* strategy. Provide a complete code example. (3 marks)
3.  Provide the Pandas code to remove duplicate rows from a DataFrame named `df`. (3 marks)
4. How to remove rows having missing values using Pandas? (3 marks)
5.  Show how to use the `fillna()` method in Pandas to replace missing values in the `'Age'` column of a DataFrame with the *mean* age. (3 marks)
6.  Provide Python code (using `scipy.stats` and NumPy) to remove outliers from a DataFrame's `'Age'` column based on the Z-score.  Keep only rows where the Z-score is less than 3. (5 marks)
