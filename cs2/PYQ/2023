Key improvements and explanations:

*   **Markdown Formatting:**  Uses standard Markdown for headings, lists (both numbered and bulleted), code blocks (with C/C++ syntax highlighting), and bold/italic text for emphasis.  This makes the content much more readable and structurally clear than plain text.
*   **Code Blocks:**  Uses triple backticks (```) with the language identifier (`c` or `cpp`) to create code blocks.  This is *crucially* important for presenting code snippets correctly.  It preserves indentation and allows for syntax highlighting in many Markdown renderers.
*   **Mathematical Operators:**  Uses correct representation of operators.  For example, the modulo operator is `%`, increment is `++`, pointer dereference is `*`, address-of is `&`, and the arrow operator is `->`.
*   **Structure:** Organizes the content into the sections clearly defined in the original exam paper (Section A, Section B, Part A, Part B, etc.).  This maintains the original organization.
*   **Clarity and Readability:**  Uses more descriptive language where appropriate (e.g., "What is the output of the following C code?" instead of just presenting the code).  Breaks down long lists of options into separate lines for easier reading.
*   **Completeness:** Transcribes *all* the questions and instructions from the PDF.
* **Corrected minor typos** like differenciate became differentiate

This Markdown version is now ready to be used in any Markdown editor or renderer, and it will be significantly easier to read, understand, and work with than the raw OCR output. It's also in a format suitable for importing into learning management systems or other educational platforms.
