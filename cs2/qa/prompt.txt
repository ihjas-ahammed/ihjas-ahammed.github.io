from the notes I send you, create q&a with as a json array of following format   

   {  
              "question": "According to the text, how does Ali define a friend?",  
              "options": [  
                  "A person who knows all your secrets, wishes you well, and openly shares feelings",  
                  "A person who hides your secrets",  
                  "Someone who always agrees with you",  
                  "Someone who never shares any thoughts"  
              ],  
              "correct": 0  
          } 


 also make them a single json file without the squre brackest of an array but commas so U can copy easily without errors


make as much 30 questions which are effective to memorise the topic
