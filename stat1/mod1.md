#  Introduction  to  statistics  


**Statistics**  is  the  science  of  collecting,  analysing,  presenting  and  interpreting  data  as  well  as  of  making  decisions  based  on  such  analysis.    

Applied  statistics  ->  Descriptive  and  Inferential

**Descriptive  statistics**  consists  of  methods  for  *organising*,  *displaying*  and  *describing*  data  by  using  tables,  graphs  and  summary  measures.  

**Inferential  statistics**  consists  of  methods  that  use  simple  results  to  help  make  decisions  on  predictions  about  a  population.    
  
**Population**  is  the  collection  of  all  elements  of  interest.  

**Sample**  is  the  selection  of  a  portion  of  the  elements  from  this  population.  

**Element**:  a  specific  subject  or  object  in  which  the  information  is  collected.  

**Variable**:  a  characteristic  under  study  that  assumes  different  values  for  different  elements.  

**Observation**:  value  of  a  variable  for  an  element.  

A  **data  set**  is  the  collection  of  observations.  

##  Quantitative  variables

A  variable  that  can  be  ```numerically  measured```  is  **quantitative**.  

###  Discrete  variables  

A  variable  who’s  values  are  ```countable```  is  called  a  **discrete**  variable.  

###  Continuous  variables.  

A  variable  that  can  have  ``any  numerical  value  over  a  certain  interval``  is  called  a  **continuous**  variable.  

##  Qualitative  or  Categorical  Variables

A  variable  that  can  only  be  ``classified  into  categories  and  can’t  be  assumed  using  numbers``  is  called  a  **qualitative**  variable.  


##  Primary  data  and  Secondary  data

**Primary  data**:  The  data  which  are  originally  collected  by  an  investigator  or  agency  for  the  first  time  for  any  statistical  investigation  and  used  by  them  in  the  statistical  analysis.

###  Methods  of  collecting  primary  data

####  I.  Direct  Personal  Investigation  

Under  this  method  of  collecting  data  there  is  a  face-to-face  contact  with  the  persons  from  the  information  is  to  be  obtained.  It  is  done  by  asking  questions.  

#####  Merits:

*  Original  data  are  collected.    
*  Reliable  information  is  obtained.  
*  There  is  uniformity  in  the  collection  of  information.  
*  Investigator  can  use  his  personal  influence  and  choice  as  the  situation  demands.    
*  The  method  gives  more  accurate    results.  

#####  Demerits:

*  It  can  be  used  only  when  the  area  of  investigation  is  small
*  It  is  more  expensive  and  time  consuming
*  The  chances  of  personal  bias  are  high

####  II.  Indirect  oral  investigation

The  data  is  collected  from  witneses  when  informants  can't  be  directly  approached,  suitable  when  the  area  of  investigation  is  large.

#####  Merits:

*  Large  area  can  be  covered
*  Simple  and  convinient
*  Economical:  saves  time,  money  and  labour
*  Supports  analysis  of  more  complex  data

#####  Demerits:

*  The  results  may  not  always  be  true  and  accurate
*  The  informants  may  give  carelessly  framed  response

###  III.  Schedules  send  through  enumerators

The  enumerators  contact  the  informants  get  replys  to  the  questions  contained  in  a  schedule  and  fill  them  in  their  own  handwriting,  in  the  questioner  form.

#####  Merits:

*  High  rate  of  response
*  Data  is  reliable  since  they  are  from  personal  contacts
*  Illitrate  information  can  also  be  approached

#####  Demerits

*  Costly  or  less  econimic  since  the  enumerator  should  be  paid
*  Time  consuming
*  Personal  bias  of  enumerator  may  lead  to  false  results

####  IV.  Mailed  questionair  method

The  questinier  with  a  request  for  quick  response  with  aims  and  objectives  of  collecting  the  information  is  mailed  to  the  informant.

#####  Merits:

*  Used  conviniently  for  large  area
*  Economical
*  Original  data  is  obtained


#####  Demerits:

*  The  accuracy  of  data  can't  be  determined
*  Informants  may  prove  unco-operative  and  hence  may  refuse  to  send  back  the  questianair
*  Information  may  be  biased
*  It  may  involve  a  long  time  log.

####  V.  Information  through  correspondent

In  this  method  the  investigator  does  not  collect  the  information  directly  from  the  respondant.  The  task  is  handed  over  to  correspondents.

#####  Merits:

*  Economical
*  Convenient
*  Can  cover  extensive  area

#####  Demerits:

*  There  is  a  lack  of  originality  in  data
*  Very  low  degree  of  accuracy
*  No  uniformity  in  the  collected  data

###  Secondary  Data

Secondary  data  is  collected  by  some  other  agency  for  similar  purpose  and  is  used  by  the  investigator  for  his  purpose.  It  is  avalible  in  the  form  of  published  or  unpublished  records.

####  Sources  of  secondary  data

*  Official  publications  of  central  governments  (Eg:  national  sample  survay,  central  statistical  organisation)
*  Publications  of  semi-government  statistical  organisation  (Statistical  Department  of  RBI)
*  Publications  of  research  multitudes
*  Publications  of  commercial  and  financial  institutes
*  Reports  of  various  commities  and  commisions  appointed  by  the  government
*  Newspapers  and  paramedicals
*  Internationals  publcations  (UNO,WHO)
