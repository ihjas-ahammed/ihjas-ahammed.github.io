# Organizing and Graphing Data

## Frequency Distribution

Arrangement of data based on values of variable.

1. Ungrouped frequency distribution
2. Grouped frequency distribution

### Ungrouped frequency distribution

In two columns (x,f) where the first one contain values of variable and the other contain how many times they repeated.

Eg:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>No. of children</th>

        <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>6</td>
    </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>5</td>
    </tr>
</table>

* Commonly descrete variable are represented
### Grouped Frequency Distribution

In grouped frequency distrutbution the first column is a range and the other is number of times the values in this range is repeated.
