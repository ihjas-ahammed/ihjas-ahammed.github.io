## 1. Overview of the Internet
The Internet is a vast, global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols like TCP/IP, forming the backbone for sharing information and accessing websites. It includes the World Wide Web (WWW), which uses HTTP/HTTPS for web pages, and other services like FTP for file transfers. Originating in the 1960s with ARPANET, its growth has revolutionized communication, commerce, and culture, making it indispensable for modern web design. Understanding its infrastructure—routers, servers, and ISPs—is crucial for designing efficient websites.

## 2. Overview of Internet Security
Internet security protects online data, devices, and networks from cyber threats like hacking, malware, phishing, and data breaches. For web designers, key practices include:
- Implementing HTTPS for encrypted data transmission.
- Using firewalls to block unauthorized access.
- Ensuring strong passwords and regular software updates to patch vulnerabilities.
- Educating users about suspicious links and complying with regulations like GDPR or CCPA.

Continuous updates and security audits are best practices to counter evolving threats, fostering user trust.

## 3. Client-Server System
The client-server system is a foundational architecture where the client (e.g., a web browser) requests resources from a server, which hosts and manages the website’s data and logic. When a user visits a site, the browser sends an HTTP request, and the server responds with HTML, CSS, and other files. This model supports scalability, allowing servers to handle multiple clients efficiently, ensuring seamless content delivery across the Internet.

## 4. Websites and Digital Communication Tools
Websites are online platforms built with:
- **HTML** for structure.
- **CSS** for styling.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity.

They serve as digital hubs for information, sales, or services. Digital communication tools enhance them by enabling real-time interaction:
- Email for direct outreach.
- Social media (e.g., Instagram) for engagement.
- Messaging apps (e.g., WhatsApp) for instant communication.
- Video conferencing (e.g., Zoom) for virtual meetings.

These tools foster community and seamless online experiences.
