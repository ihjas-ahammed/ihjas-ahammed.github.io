The Patient's Clinic

By Abul Hasan Ali Nadwi

Hamid went to school on Saturday and found that his friend, Hussain, was absent. He asked Hussain's brother, Ali, about the reason. Ali replied, "He has been sick with a fever since Thursday." Hamid decided to visit him on his way back from school.

Hamid went to Hussain's house, greeted them, and asked for permission to enter. Hussain's father came out. Hamid said, "I would like to visit my friend, Hussain. Ali told me he is ill." His father replied, "Yes, he was struck by fever on Thursday, and you can visit him."

Hamid entered Hussain's room and saw Hussain lying down. He greeted him gently, approached him, and said, "How are you, my brother? May Allah grant you health!"

Hussain said, "I was struck by fever on Thursday, and it became severe on Friday. It lessened during the night, but I still suffer from a headache after waking up and dizziness. I have become very weak, as if I've been sick for days, and I have no appetite."

Hamid said, "No problem, may it be a purification, God willing. Has a doctor visited you?"

Hussain replied, "Yes, a doctor visited me yesterday, and his appointment is now."

Hamid had only sat for a short while when the doctor arrived. He felt Hussain's hand, measured his temperature, examined his chest with a stethoscope, expressed satisfaction, made a slight change to the prescription, and said, "He is recovering, praise be to God." He advised his father to keep Hussain away from cold water, oil, going out in the air, and exertion, and to give him milk, barley water, and fruit juice.

Hamid sat for a little while longer and then said, "If a visitor stays too long with the patient, it becomes difficult for him and his family. So, I will take my leave and depart, and I will return tomorrow, God willing."
