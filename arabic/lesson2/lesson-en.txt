Unit 2:

That is nature, stop with us, O traveler!

By Ahmed Shawqi

That is nature, stop with us, O traveler!

So that I may show you the wonder of the Creator's work.

The earth around you and the sky have trembled

At the splendor of the signs and monuments.

From every eloquent speaker of majesty, it is as if

It is the mother of the book on the tongue of the reciter.

It pointed to the King of kings, so it did not leave

For the evidence of the jurists and scholars.

Whoever doubts it, then a look at its making

Erases the sinful doubt and denial.

How many in the thickets, which are but some of its maids

Of those with anklets and those with bracelets.

And a smiling one with teeth that fill the world with brightness

And a drowning one in her abundant tears.

And you pass by the pond, you imagine it

And the plant is a mirror adorned with a frame.
