**From this message:**

**The virtue of knowledge, work, and earning a livelihood**

The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, urges us to seek knowledge, work, and strive to earn a livelihood, and he encourages us to do so in various ways:

1: On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said:

"When a man dies, his deeds come to an end except for three: an ongoing charity, knowledge that is benefited from, or a righteous child who prays for him." (Reported by Muslim)

2: On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him) said:

"Whoever relieves a believer of a burden from the burdens of this world, Allah will relieve him of a burden from the burdens of the Day of Resurrection. Whoever makes things easy for a hard-pressed person, Allah will make things easy for him in this world and the Hereafter. Whoever conceals [the faults of] a Muslim, Allah will conceal him in this world and the Hereafter.

Allah is in the aid of His slave as long as the slave is in the aid of his brother. Whoever treads a path seeking knowledge therein, Allah will make easy for him a path to Paradise." (Reported by Muslim)

3: On the authority of Al-Miqdam (may Allah be pleased with him): The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:

"No one ever eats better food than that which he earns by working with his own hands. Indeed, the Prophet of Allah, David (peace be upon him), used to eat from the work of his own hands." (Reported by Bukhari)

4: On the authority of Az-Zubayr ibn Al-`Awwam (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:

"It is better for one of you to take his rope and bring a bundle of firewood on his back and sell it, by which Allah suffices him, than to ask people who may give him or withhold from him." (Reported by Bukhari)
