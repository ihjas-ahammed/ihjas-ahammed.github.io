**Key Principles Across All Topics**

*   **Pattern Recognition:**  The vast majority of these problems rely on identifying patterns.  This might be a numerical sequence, a repeating visual element, a logical relationship, or a coding rule.  Practice is key to developing this skill.
*   **Systematic Approach:**  Don't just guess!  Develop a systematic way to analyze each problem.  This might involve:
    *   Writing down key information.
    *   Drawing diagrams (especially for spatial reasoning).
    *   Eliminating obviously wrong answers.
    *   Working step-by-step.
*   **Time Management:**  Competitive exams are time-pressured.  Practice solving problems quickly *and* accurately.  Learn to recognize when you're spending too long on a problem and should move on.
* **Practice, practice, practice:** Should try every check yourself section question.

**Detailed Breakdown of Each Unit**

**(I) Non-Verbal Reasoning**

   1.  **Similarity of Pairs (Analogy):**

      *   **Concept:**  You're given a pair of figures that have a specific relationship.  You must identify the same relationship in another pair of figures, choosing the correct answer from options.
      *   **Relationships:**  These can be based on:
          *   Rotation (clockwise or counter-clockwise)
          *   Reflection (mirror image)
          *   Addition or removal of elements
          *   Changes in size, shape, or shading
          *   Combinations of the above
      *   **Example:**  Figure A is a square.  Figure B is a square rotated 90 degrees clockwise.  Figure C is a triangle.  What is Figure D?  (Answer: A triangle rotated 90 degrees clockwise.)
          *   **Solution process** First identify the relationship between the two figures, figure A and figure B. Here figure B is just the 90 degree rotation of figure A. Applying the same logic, we will rotate the figure C by 90 degree.
      *   **Strategy:**  Carefully examine the first pair.  Verbally describe the relationship to yourself ("The second figure is the first figure flipped upside down").  Then apply that *exact* description to the second pair.

   2.  **What Comes Next (Series):**

      *   **Concept:**  You're given a sequence of figures that follow a pattern.  You must determine the next figure in the sequence.
      *   **Patterns:**  Similar to analogies, but often involve more complex, multi-step changes.  Look for:
          *   Progressive changes (e.g., a shape adding a side in each step)
          *   Alternating patterns (e.g., two different changes happening in turn)
          *   Changes in multiple elements simultaneously
      *   **Example:**  Figure 1: One dot.  Figure 2: Two dots.  Figure 3: Three dots.  What is Figure 4? (Answer: Four dots.)
      *   **Strategy:**  Analyze the changes *between* consecutive figures.  Write down the changes if necessary.  Look for patterns that repeat or progress logically.

   3.  **Odd One Out (Classification):**

      *   **Concept:**  You're given a set of figures, and you must identify the one that *doesn't* fit the pattern shared by the others.
      *   **Strategy:**  Look for common characteristics among *most* of the figures.  The odd one out will lack this characteristic or have a different one.  Consider:
          *   Shape, size, number of elements
          *   Orientation, rotation
          *   Shading, internal patterns
          *   Symmetry
      *   **Example:**  Four figures show squares; one shows a circle.  The circle is the odd one out.

   4.  **Coding and Decoding:**
      *   **Concept:** Given figures will be coded in certain manner, we have to identfy the patterns.
      *   **Example:** Figure 1: One dot. Figure 2: Two dots. Figure 3: Three dots
       Figure 1 is coded as A, figure 2 is coded as B. Then, Figure 3 will be coded as C.
       *   **Solution process** First identify the relationship between the two figures, figure 1 and it's code A. Then figure 2 and it's code B. Here, Figure 1, 2 are coded as A, B respectively. Applying the same logic, we will code the figure 3 by C.

   5. **Ranking Test:**
       *    **Concept:** Here, Ranking of figures needs to be found based on ceratin pattern.
       * **Example:** Given 5 figures. First identify pattern of figures, then rank the figures based on the increasing/ decreasing order.

**(II) Reasoning Contd.**

   6.  **Blood Relations:**

      *   **Concept:**  Problems describe relationships between family members (father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, cousin, etc.).  You must deduce a specific relationship based on the given information.
      *   **Strategy:**
          *   **Draw a family tree.** This is *essential* for visualizing the relationships.  Use symbols (e.g., squares for males, circles for females, lines for marriage/parent-child relationships).
          *   **Work step-by-step.**  Break down complex sentences into smaller, manageable pieces of information.
          *   **Use standard abbreviations:** M (Mother), F (Father), S (Son), D (Daughter), B (Brother), Si (Sister)
          *   **Be careful with gender assumptions.**  Don't assume someone's gender unless it's explicitly stated.
      *   **Example:**  "A is B's brother. C is A's mother. D is C's father. E is B's son. How is D related to A?"
          *   **Solution:**
              1.  A is B's brother (A and B are siblings, both male).
              2.  C is A's mother (C is the parent of A and B).
              3.  D is C's father (D is C's parent, and therefore A and B's grandfather).
              4.  E is B's son.
              *   Answer: D is A's grandfather.

   7.  **Blood Relations Contd.:**  More complex blood relation problems, possibly involving coded relationships (e.g., "A + B means A is the father of B").  The same strategies apply, but careful attention to the code is crucial.

   8.  **Direction Sense Test:**

      *   **Concept:**  Problems involve determining directions (North, South, East, West, and their combinations) and distances.  A person or object moves in a series of directions, and you must determine their final position or direction relative to the starting point.
      *   **Strategy:**
          *   **Draw a diagram.**  This is *absolutely essential*.  Start with a clear point of origin.  Represent each movement with an arrow, clearly labeling the direction and distance.
          *   **Use a compass rose:**  A simple diagram showing North, South, East, and West.
          *   **Remember turns:**  "Turning right" from North means facing East.  "Turning left" from South means facing East.
          *   **Pythagorean Theorem:**  If the movements involve right angles, you might need to use the Pythagorean theorem ($a^2 + b^2 = c^2$) to calculate the final distance.
      *   **Example:**  "A man walks 5 km North, then turns right and walks 3 km. Then he turns left and walks 2 km. How far is he from the starting point, and in what direction?"
      *     1. Draw diagram as mentioned in strategy, with proper arrows.
            2. Distance calculation = 5+2 = 7.
          *   Answer: Distance = 7KM, Direction: North.

   9.  **Direction Sense Test contd.:**  More complex direction problems, possibly involving multiple people or objects, or changes in direction based on certain conditions.

   10. **Logical Venn Diagram:**

      *   **Concept:**  Uses overlapping circles to represent relationships between sets of items.  You must interpret the diagram to answer questions about the relationships.
      *   **Key Areas:**
          *   **Intersection (overlap):**  Represents items that belong to *both* sets.
          *   **Union (entire area of both circles):**  Represents items that belong to *either* set.
          *   **Outside the circles:**  Represents items that belong to *neither* set.
      *   **Example:**  Two circles: one for "Doctors," one for "Women."  The overlapping area represents "Female Doctors."
      *   **Strategy:**  Carefully read the descriptions of each circle.  Shade or label the relevant areas to help visualize the answer.  Pay attention to words like "only," "all," "some," and "none."

**(III) Spatial Reasoning**

   11. **Figure Analogy:**  Same as "Similarity of Pairs" (covered above).

   12. **Figure Series:**  Same as "What Comes Next" (covered above).

   13. **Figure Classification:**  Same as "Odd One Out" (covered above).

   14. **Mirror and Water Images:**

      *   **Concept:**  You're given a figure and must determine its mirror image (reflection across a vertical line) or water image (reflection across a horizontal line).
      *   **Mirror Image:**  Left and right are reversed, but top and bottom remain the same.
      *   **Water Image:**  Top and bottom are reversed, but left and right remain the same.
      *   **Strategy:**
          *   **Visualize the reflection.**  Imagine folding the paper along the mirror line or water line.
          *   **Focus on key features.**  Look at how specific points or lines in the original figure will be positioned in the reflection.
          *   **Eliminate incorrect answers.**  Often, you can quickly rule out options that don't have the correct basic orientation.
          * **Example**  
            Mirror Image: Given 'pq', it's mirror image is 'qp'.
            Water Image: Given, 'pq', it's water image is 'db'.

   15. **Counting of Figures:**

      *   **Concept:**  You're given a complex figure composed of simpler shapes (triangles, squares, rectangles, etc.), and you must count the total number of a specific shape within the figure.
      *   **Strategy:**
          *   **Be systematic.**  Don't just randomly count.  Start with the smallest shapes and work your way up to larger ones.
          *   **Mark or label.**  As you count, mark the shapes you've already counted to avoid double-counting.
          *   **Divide and conquer.**  Break the complex figure into smaller, more manageable sections.
      *   **Example:** A large triangle divided into many smaller triangles. Count *all* the triangles, including the large one and combinations of smaller ones.

**(IV) Abstract Reasoning**

   16. **Cube and Dice:**

      *   **Concept:**  Problems involve visualizing and analyzing three-dimensional cubes and dice.  You might be given a folded or unfolded cube and asked to determine the opposite face, or to identify which cube can be formed from a given net.
      *   **Key Concepts:**
          *   **Opposite faces:**  On a standard die, opposite faces always add up to 7 (1 is opposite 6, 2 is opposite 5, 3 is opposite 4).
          *   **Net of a cube:**  A 2D pattern that can be folded to form a cube.  There are multiple possible nets.
          *   **Rotation:**  You must be able to mentally rotate the cube to visualize different faces.
      *   **Strategy:**
          *   **Visualize folding.**  For net problems, imagine folding the net into a cube.
          *   **Use the "opposite faces" rule.**  For standard dice problems.
          *   **Look for adjacent faces.**  Faces that are next to each other on the net will also be adjacent on the folded cube.
          *   **Eliminate impossible options.**  Often, you can rule out nets that would result in the same number appearing on adjacent faces.

   17. **Logical and Analytical Reasoning:**  This is a broad category that encompasses various problem types, including:

      *   **Syllogisms:**  Given a set of statements (premises), you must determine whether a conclusion logically follows from those premises.  Often involves using Venn diagrams.
           **Example**
           Statement: All A are B. All B are C.
           Conclusion: All A are C.
      *   **Statement and Assumptions:** Given a statement, identify the underlying assumption.
      *   **Statement and Conclusions**
      *   **Statement and Arguments**
      *   **Course of Action**
      *   **Cause and Effect**
      *   **Critical Reasoning:**  Analyzing arguments, identifying flaws in reasoning, drawing inferences.

      *   **General Strategies:**
          *   **Read carefully.**  Pay close attention to the wording of the statements.
          *   **Identify key terms.**  Look for words like "all," "some," "none," "only," "if," "then," "must," "could."
          *   **Don't assume anything beyond the given information.**
          *   **Use diagrams or symbols** to represent the relationships.

   18. **Geometry Mensuration:**

      *   **Concept:**  Applies geometric principles to solve problems involving shapes and their properties (area, perimeter, volume, etc.).  You might need to know formulas for:
          *   **Triangles:**  Area = (1/2) * base * height; Perimeter = sum of sides
          *   **Squares:**  Area = side * side; Perimeter = 4 * side
          *   **Rectangles:**  Area = length * width; Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
          *   **Circles:**  Area = π * radius^2; Circumference = 2 * π * radius
          *   **Cubes:** Volume = side^3; Surface area = 6 * side^2
          *   **Cuboids:** Volume = length * width * height
          *   **Cylinders:** Volume = π * radius^2 * height
          * **Basic Trigonometry**
      *   **Strategy:**
          *   **Identify the relevant shapes.**
          *   **Write down the known information and the formulas you need.**
          *   **Substitute the values into the formulas and solve.**
          *   **Pay attention to units.**

   19. **Data Interpretation:**

      *   **Concept:**  Analyzing data presented in tables, charts, or graphs (bar graphs, pie charts, line graphs) and answering questions based on the data.
      *   **Key Skills:**
          *   **Reading and understanding the data presentation.**  Identify the axes, labels, and units.
          *   **Calculating percentages, averages, ratios, and differences.**
          *   **Identifying trends and patterns.**
          *   **Drawing inferences and conclusions.**
      *   **Strategy:**
          *   **Read the questions carefully *before* looking at the data.**  This helps you focus on the relevant information.
          *   **Estimate when possible.**  You often don't need to do precise calculations.
          *   **Double-check your work.**
