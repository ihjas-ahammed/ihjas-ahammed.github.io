## Correlation

Correlation is a statistical measure for finding out the degree of association or relationship between 2 variables. By association, we mean the tendency of the variables to move together. Correlation is said to be:

1. **Positive (+ve) Correlation**: If the movements of the two variables are in the same direction, then the two variables are said to be +ve. For example, height and weight.

2. **Negative (-ve) Correlation**: If the change of the two variables are in the opposite direction, then the correlation is said to be -ve. For example, pressure and volume.

3. **No Correlation (0)**: If the change of the variables are not related, then the correlation is said to be 0 or no correlation.

### Correlation Coefficient (r)
The correlation coefficient (r) measures the degree of linear relationship between two variables. It lies between -1 and +1, represented as $$-1 ≤ r ≤ +1$$



# Methods for Finding Correlation

Correlation between two variables may be determined by any of the following methods:

1. Scatter Diagram method or Karl Pearson's covariance method
2. Spearman's Rank method

## Scatter Diagram

It is the diagrammatic representation of the existence of correlation between two variables. Statistical data relating simultaneous movements of variables can be represented by points or dots. One of the variables $X$ is shown along the $x$-axis and the other along the $y$-axis. Pairs of values of $x$ and $y$ are shown by points along the $x$-$y$ plane.

The scatter diagram of these points also reveals the direction and strength of correlation between two variables.

### Examples of Perfect Correlation
- Perfect +ve correlation: $r = +1$
- Perfect -ve correlation: $r = -1$
