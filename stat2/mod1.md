# Discrete Random Variables and Their Probability Distribution

## Random Variable and Probability Distribution

A random variable is a function from a sample space to a real number.

Eg: For two coins tossed at same time,

S = {HH,HT,TH,TT}

Here let's define a random variable ```x``` as number of heads.

<table>
<tr><th></th><th>HH</th><th>HT</th><th>TH</th><th>TT</th></tr>
<tr><th>x</th><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><th>p</th><td>p(x=2)=1/4</td><td>p(x=1)=1/2</td><td>p(x=1)=1/2</td><td>p(x=0)=1/4</td></tr>
</table>

This table is called probability distribution (like a frequency distribution)

E(x) which is expectation of x is also mean of the probability distribution

E(x)= âˆ‘ x<sub>i</sub>p(x=x<sub>i</sub>)
