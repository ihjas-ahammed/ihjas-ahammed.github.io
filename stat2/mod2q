# 1. Probability Density Function (PDF)

1. Define the probability density function (PDF) of a continuous random variable and state any two of its properties. (5 marks)


# 2. Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

1. Given the probability density function (PDF) of a random variable $X$ as $f(x) = 3x^2$ for $0 < x < 1$, find the cumulative distribution function (CDF), $F(x)$.  (This question requires calculation, but defining what a CDF is would come from the text.)


# 3.  Moments and Moment Generating Functions

1. Define the Mathematical Expectation of a random variable. (3 marks)

2. What are the properties of a Moment Generating Function? (3 marks)
3. Explain the two methods of obtaining the *raw moments* of X using the moment generating function of X. (10 marks)



# 5.  Variance and Covariance

1. Prove that for any random variable $X$, the variance $V(X)$ is always non-negative. (3 marks)
   
2. Show that for any Random Variable $X$ that $Cov(X,X)=V(X)$. (3 marks)


# 6. Independence and Covariance

1. If X and Y are two independent random variables, prove that their covariance, $Cov(X,Y)$, is equal to 0.  Show that the converse is not necessarily true (i.e., $Cov(X,Y) = 0$ does not always imply independence). (10 marks)



# 8. Uniform Distribution

1. Find the variance of the continuous uniform (rectangular) distribution with probability density function (PDF) $f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}$ for $a \leq x \leq b$. (Requires calculation, but understanding the variance formula in relation to a PDF comes from the text.) (3 marks)



# 10.  Normal Distribution

1. Explain the properties of the Normal Distribution. (10 marks)
