        <p class="mb-4 text-lg">
            Substances that have resistivity in between conductors and insulators are termed as semiconductors.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>E.g.:</strong> Ge, Si, C etc. (Resistivity range ~ <code class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded">10<sup>-4</sup></code> to <code class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded">10<sup>4</sup></code> Ωm)
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Their difference is resistivity with resistance materials like nichrome (<code class="bg-gray-200 px-1 rounded">~10<sup>-6</sup> Ωm</code>) makes them prove they can't be used as resistance material (e.g. Nichrome 0.6 Ωm/m² ??). <!-- Note: Unit seems unusual -->
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-blue-600">Key Properties</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Not only resistivity alone can decide a semiconductor, it has the following properties:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
            <li>Resistivity less than insulator but more than a conductor.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Negative temperature coefficient (NTC):</strong> Resistance decreases with increase in temperature.
            </li>
            <li>
                By adding impurities (e.g., B, As, Cu <!-- Note: Cu is not a typical dopant -->), we can alter its conduction properties.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-blue-600">Bonding and Structure</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Semiconductors form covalent bonds by sharing four valence electrons.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            These substances are arranged in a crystalline structure.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            Ge, Si are mainly used semiconductors since their energy gap is very low. (e.g., 1.1 eV) <!-- Note: Energy gap value added for context -->
            <!-- Original text: Y energy to break bonds -->
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-600">Germanium (Ge)</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Energy Gap (ΔE) ≈ 0.7eV <!-- Note: Value from text --></li>
            <li>32 electrons</li>

            <li>It can be purified relatively well and crystallized easily.</li>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-blue-600">Energy Bands (Ge, Si)</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">
            <strong>Definition:</strong> In terms of energy bands, a semiconductor is a substance which has an almost filled valence band and nearly empty conduction band.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-blue-600">Temperature Effects on Semiconductors (SC)</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-600">i. At absolute zero (0 Kelvin)</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>No free electrons, since all of them are tightly held in covalent bonds.</li>
            <li>So SC behaves as a perfect insulator.</li>
            <li>Energy gap between valence and conduction band is too large for electrons to jump.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-600">ii. Above absolute zero</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>A few free electrons exist, since some covalent bonds are broken due to thermal energy (heat).</li>
            <li>These free electrons can cause current flow if potential is applied.</li>
            <li>Resistance decreases as you heat up the SC (Negative Temperature Coefficient).</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="note-block">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Each time an electron moves to the conduction band as a free electron, a hole is created in the valence band.
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-blue-600">Hole Current Concept</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Thermal energy creates electron-hole pairs.</li>
            <li>Hole movement is caused by holes attracting nearby valence electrons (filling the hole, creating a new one).</li>
            <li>So it is actually due to the movement of valence electrons from one covalent bond to another.</li>
            <li>Still, it seems like the positive holes are moving, hence it is called hole current.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-blue-600">Intrinsic vs Extrinsic SC; Doping</h2>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-600">Intrinsic SC</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">An SC that is extremely pure form.</p>

            <img src="./img/img4.png" alt="Block diagram of intrinsic semiconductor" class="mx-auto max-w-xs h-auto mb-2 opacity-50">
        </div>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>The current conduction is due to both holes and electrons generated thermally at room temperature, i.e., I<sub>net</sub> = I<sub>e</sub> + I<sub>h</sub>.</li>
            <li>In external wires, there are only electrons since they recombine with holes. <!-- Simplified explanation --></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3 text-blue-600">Extrinsic SC</h3>
        <p class="mb-2">Created by adding a small amount of impurity to an intrinsic SC to improve its conductivity.</p>
         <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>The process of adding impurities is called <strong>doping</strong>.</li>
            <li>It is done either to increase the number of free electrons (creating n-type) or holes (creating p-type).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-blue-600">N-type & P-type Semiconductors</h2>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Pentavalent impurity (5 valence electrons) is added to the intrinsic SC.</li>
            <li>Examples: Arsenic (As) or Antimony (Sb). These are called <strong>donor</strong> impurities.</li>
            <li>They provide more free electrons.</li>

            <li>Trivalent impurity (3 valence electrons) is added to the intrinsic SC.</li>
            <li>Examples: Gallium (Ga) or Indium (In). These are called <strong>acceptor</strong> impurities.</li>
             <li>They provide more holes (vacancies for electrons).</li>

        </ul>
         <div class="note-block">
            <strong>Note:</strong> Because of the fixed negative charge of the acceptor ions (which have accepted an electron to complete a bond), the net charge of the p-type material as a whole is zero (similarly for n-type with fixed positive donor ions). <!-- Clarified based on notes -->

        <p class="mb-4">
            The contact surface or interface formed when an n-type semiconductor is suitably joined to a p-type semiconductor is called a <strong>PN Junction</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
            It is the fundamental control element for many semiconductor devices (like diodes, transistors).

                    <li>Indium melts and fuses with the n-type Ge. Where they fuse, the In atoms create a p-type region, forming a PN junction.</li>

         <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-4 space-y-1">
             <li>Due to the concentration difference, electrons from the n-region diffuse across the junction into the p-region, and holes from the p-region diffuse into the n-region.</li>
             <li>Electrons combine with holes near the junction on the p-side, and holes combine with electrons near the junction on the n-side.</li>
             <li>This leaves behind uncovered positive donor ions (+) on the n-side and uncovered negative acceptor ions (-) on the p-side, near the junction.</li>

         </p>
         <p class="mb-4">
             This creates a potential difference across the junction called the <strong>barrier potential</strong> (V<sub>0</sub>) or contact potential.

            <li>Electrons cross the junction, move through the p-side (by sequential movement through valence band/recombination), and reach the positive terminal.</li>
            <li>Holes cross the junction, move through the n-side (effectively), and are neutralized by electrons from the negative terminal near the contact.</li>
            <li>Electrons are continuously supplied by the negative terminal to the n-side, and removed from the p-side by the positive terminal, maintaining the current flow.</li>
             <!-- Simplified interpretation of notes: "electrons from n-side move to junction - then through p-side as valence electrons and finally reach positive terminal. Their places are filled by more electrons from negative terminal. ... to the balance electrons moving, left means holes moving, right" -->
