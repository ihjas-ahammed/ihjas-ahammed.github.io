### 5.1 Semiconductors
Semiconductors are materials with electrical conductivity between conductors and insulators, characterized by resistivity (e.g., Germanium: 0.6 Ω m, much higher than copper’s 1.7 × 10⁻⁸ Ω m but lower than glass’s 10¹⁰ Ω m). Unlike resistance materials (e.g., Nichrome: 10⁻⁶ Ω m), semiconductors have a negative temperature coefficient of resistance—conductivity increases with temperature—and their properties can be altered by impurities (doping).

### 5.2 Bonds in Semiconductors
Semiconductors form covalent bonds by sharing valence electrons to achieve a stable octet. For example, a germanium atom (4 valence electrons) shares electrons with four neighbors, forming a tetrahedral structure.

### 5.3 Crystals
Semiconductors like germanium and silicon have a crystalline structure with atoms arranged in an orderly, repetitive pattern.

### 5.4 Commonly Used Semiconductors
Germanium (Ge, 32 electrons, 4 valence) and silicon (Si, 14 electrons, 4 valence) are widely used due to their small energy gaps (Ge: 0.7 eV, Si: 1.1 eV) and ability to form covalent bonds in a crystal lattice.

### 5.5 Energy Band Description
Semiconductors have a nearly full valence band and a nearly empty conduction band, separated by a small energy gap (~1 eV). At room temperature, some electrons jump to the conduction band, enabling limited conductivity.

### 5.6 Effect of Temperature
At absolute zero, semiconductors act as insulators (no free electrons). Above zero, thermal energy breaks covalent bonds, freeing electrons and creating holes, increasing conductivity.

### 5.7 Hole Current
Thermal energy creates electron-hole pairs. Electrons move toward the positive terminal, while holes (positive vacancies) move oppositely, contributing to current via valence electron shifts.

### 5.8 Intrinsic Semiconductor
Pure semiconductors conduct via thermally generated electron-hole pairs, with equal numbers of electrons and holes contributing to current under an electric field.

### 5.9 Extrinsic Semiconductor
Doping with impurities enhances conductivity. Pentavalent impurities (e.g., arsenic) create n-type semiconductors (excess electrons), while trivalent impurities (e.g., gallium) create p-type (excess holes).

### 5.10 n-type Semiconductor
Pentavalent doping (e.g., arsenic in germanium) adds free electrons (majority carriers), with holes as minority carriers, leading to electron-dominated conductivity.

### 5.11 p-type Semiconductor
Trivalent doping (e.g., gallium in germanium) creates holes (majority carriers), with electrons as minority carriers, leading to hole-dominated conductivity.

### 5.12 Charge Neutrality
Both n-type and p-type semiconductors remain electrically neutral despite excess carriers, as impurities are neutral atoms.

### 5.13 Majority and Minority Carriers
In n-type, electrons are majority carriers, holes minority; in p-type, holes are majority, electrons minority, due to doping effects overpowering thermal pairs.

### 5.14 p-n Junction
A p-n junction forms at the interface of p-type and n-type materials, crucial for semiconductor devices, fabricated via techniques like alloying.

### 5.16 Biasing p-n Junction
- **Forward Bias**: Positive to p-type, negative to n-type reduces the barrier, allowing current.
- **Reverse Bias**: Opposite polarity increases the barrier, blocking current except for minor leakage.

### 5.17 Current Flow in Forward Bias
Electrons flow from n-type to p-type, recombining with holes; holes move oppositely, with external current carried by electrons.

### 5.18 Volt-Ampere Characteristics
- **Zero Bias**: No current (barrier blocks flow).
- **Forward Bias**: Exponential current increase with voltage.
- **Reverse Bias**: Minimal leakage until breakdown.

### 7.1 Zener Diode
A heavily doped diode operating in reverse breakdown (constant voltage, Vz) for regulation, with sharp current increase at Vz.

### 7.2 Light-Emitting Diode (LED)
Forward-biased LEDs (e.g., gallium arsenide) emit light when electrons recombine with holes, with colors varying by material.

### 7.3 LED Voltage and Current
LEDs operate at 1-3 V, 20-100 mA, requiring a series resistor (Rs) to limit current (e.g., Rs = (Vs - VD) / IF).

### 7.4 Advantages of LED
Long life (>20 years) and fast switching; protected from reverse bias by a parallel rectifier diode.

### 7.5 Multicolour LEDs
Contain two pn junctions in reverse-parallel, emitting different colors (e.g., red/green) based on bias direction; rapid switching yields a third color (e.g., yellow).

### 7.6 Applications of LEDs
Used as power indicators and in seven-segment displays for low-power indication, not illumination.

### 7.7 Photo-diode
Reverse-biased pn junction where reverse current increases with light intensity due to photon-generated electron-hole pairs.

### 7.8 Photo-diode Operation
- **Dark Current**: Low reverse current without light.
- **Saturation Current**: Maximum current with high light intensity.

### 7.9 Characteristics of Photo-diode
- **Reverse Current-Illumination**: Linear increase (I_R = mE).
- **Reverse Current-Voltage**: Higher illumination yields higher current at constant voltage.

### 7.10 Applications of Photo-diodes
Used in alarms (light beam interruption triggers sound) and counters (beam breaks increment count).
