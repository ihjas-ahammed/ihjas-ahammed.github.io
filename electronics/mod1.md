# 5.1 Semiconductors

It is not easy to define a semiconductor if we want to take into account all its physical characteristics. However, generally, a semiconductor is defined on the basis of electrical conductivity as under:

The reader may wonder, when a semiconductor is neither a good conductor nor an insulator, then why not to classify it as a resistance material? The answer shall be readily available if we study the following table:

| S.No. | Substance      | Nature              | Resistivity         |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 1     | Copper         | good conductor      | 1.7 × 10⁻⁸ Ω m      |
| 2     | Germanium      | semiconductor       | 0.6 Ω m             |
| 3     | Glass          | insulator           | 10¹⁰ Ω m            |
| 4     | Nichrome       | resistance material | 10⁻⁶ Ω m            |

Comparing the resistivities of above materials, it is apparent that the resistivity of germanium (a semiconductor) is quite high compared to copper (a conductor) but it is quite low when compared with glass (an insulator). However, it will be wrong to consider the semiconductor as a resistance material. For example, nichrome, which is one of the highest resistance materials, has a resistance much lower than germanium. This shows that electrically germanium cannot be regarded as a conductor or insulator or a resistance material. This gives such substances like germanium the name of semiconductors.

Semiconductors have negative temperature co-efficient of resistance i.e. the resistance of a semiconductor decreases with the increase in temperature and vice-versa. For example, germanium becomes a good conductor at high temperatures but becomes a good insulator at low temperatures.

(ii) When a suitable metallic impurity (e.g. arsenic, gallium etc.) is added to a semiconductor, its current conducting properties change appreciably. This property is most important and is discussed later in detail.

# 5.2 Bonds in Semiconductors

The atoms of every element are held together by the bonding action of valence electrons. This bonding occurs because each atom has a tendency to complete its outermost electron shell by acquiring 8 electrons, which is a stable configuration. However, in most substances, the outermost shell, or valence shell, is incomplete, meaning it does not have 8 electrons. This makes the atom active and likely to interact with other atoms to achieve a stable configuration of 8 electrons in its valence shell. To do so, the atom may lose, gain, or share valence electrons with other atoms.

In semiconductors, bonds are formed through the sharing of valence electrons, and these bonds are called covalent bonds. In a covalent bond, each atom contributes an equal number of valence electrons, and these shared electrons are collectively used by the atoms involved in forming the bond.

For example, consider a germanium atom, which has four valence electrons. Each germanium atom naturally seeks to have 8 electrons in its valence shell to achieve stability. To accomplish this, a germanium atom positions itself among four other germanium atoms. Each of these neighboring germanium atoms shares one of its valence electrons with the central germanium atom. Through this sharing, the central atom effectively completes its valence shell, achieving a stable configuration of 8 electrons. This process of sharing electrons between atoms results in the formation of covalent bonds, creating a stable structure in the semiconductor material.

The following points are important to understand about covalent bonds in semiconductors:

- Covalent bonds are formed by the sharing of valence electrons between atoms.
- In the formation of a covalent bond, the valence electrons from adjacent atoms pair up to create a direct bond. This means the valence electrons are associated with specific atoms rather than being free to move, which is a key characteristic of semiconductors.

# 5.3 Crystals

A substance in which the atoms or molecules are arranged in an orderly, repetitive pattern is known as a crystal. All semiconductors have a crystalline structure. For example, a piece of germanium, with its atoms surrounded by neighboring atoms in a repetitive manner, is generally referred to as a germanium crystal.

# 5.4 Commonly Used Semiconductors

There are many semiconductors available, but very few of them have practical applications in electronics. The two most frequently used materials are germanium (Ge) and silicon (Si). It is very small; being about 0.7 eV for germanium and about 1.1 eV for silicon. Therefore, we shall discuss these two semiconductors in detail.

- A germanium atom has 32 electrons. The first orbit has 2 electrons, the second 8 electrons, the third 18 electrons, and the fourth orbit has 4 electrons.

### (i) Germanium
Germanium has become the model substance among semiconductors; the main reason being that it can be purified relatively well and crystallised easily. Germanium is an earth element and was discovered in 1886. It is recovered from the ash of certain coals or from the flue dust of zinc smelters. Generally, recovered germanium is in the form of germanium dioxide powder, which is then reduced to pure germanium.

The atomic number of germanium is 32. Therefore, it has 32 protons and 32 electrons. Two electrons are in the first orbit, eight electrons in the second, eighteen electrons in the third, and four electrons in the outer or valence orbit. It is clear that a germanium atom has four valence electrons, i.e., it is a tetravalent element. These valence electrons hold the germanium atoms together through co-valent bonds. As the atoms are arranged in an orderly pattern, therefore, germanium has a crystalline structure.

This represents the germanium atoms forming a tetrahedral structure, with each germanium (Ge) atom bonded to four others through covalent bonds, creating an orderly, crystalline pattern.

### (ii) Silicon
Silicon is an element in most of the common rocks. Actually, sand is silicon dioxide, and compounds are chemically reduced to silicon, which is 100% pure for use as a semiconductor.

The atomic number of silicon is 14. Therefore, it has 14 protons and 14 electrons. Two electrons are in the first orbit, eight electrons in the second orbit, and four electrons in the outer or valence orbit. It is clear that a silicon atom has four valence electrons, i.e., it is a tetravalent element. These valence electrons hold the silicon atoms together through co-valent bonds. Like germanium, silicon atoms are also arranged in an orderly manner. Therefore, silicon has a crystalline structure.

# 5.5 Energy Band Description of Semiconductors

It has already been discussed that a semiconductor is a substance whose resistivity lies between conductors and insulators, much more comprehensively on the basis of energy bands.

A semiconductor is a substance which has almost filled valence band and nearly empty conduction band with a very small energy gap (≈ 1 eV) separating the two.

The energy band diagrams of germanium and silicon show that the forbidden energy gap is very small, being 1.1 eV for silicon and 0.7 eV for germanium. The relatively small energy gap means that at room temperature, some of the valence electrons may acquire sufficient energy to enter the conduction band and thus become free electrons. However, at this temperature, the number of free electrons available is very “small.” Therefore, at room temperature, a piece of germanium or silicon is neither a good conductor nor an insulator. For this reason, such substances are called semiconductors.

The energy band description is extremely helpful in understanding the current flow through a semiconductor. Therefore, we shall frequently use this concept in our further discussion.

# 5.6 Effect of Temperature on Semiconductors

The electrical conductivity of a semiconductor changes appreciably with temperature variations. This is a very important point to keep in mind.

## (i) At Absolute Zero
At absolute zero, the semiconductor atoms have no thermal energy, and the inner orbit electrons are tightly held by the valence electrons, which are engaged in covalent bonding. At this temperature, the covalent bonds are very strong, and there are no free electrons. Therefore, the semiconductor crystal behaves as a perfect insulator. In terms of energy band description, the valence band is filled, and there is a large energy gap between the valence band and the conduction band. There is no availability of free electrons that can reach the conduction band. It is due to the non-availability of free electrons that a semiconductor behaves as an insulator.

Out of 10^8 semiconductor atoms, only one provides a free electron.

The semiconductor breaks due to the thermal energy supplied. The breaking of some of the covalent bonds in the semiconductor lattice results in a few free electrons existing in the semiconductor. These free electrons can constitute a tiny electric current if a potential difference exists in the semiconductor.

## (ii) Above Absolute Zero
When the temperature is raised, some of the covalent bonds in the semiconductor break due to the thermal energy supplied. The breaking of bonds sets those electrons free, which are engaged in the formation of these bonds. The result is that a few free electrons exist in the semiconductor. These free electrons can constitute a tiny electric current if a potential difference exists in the semiconductor.

As the temperature is raised, some of the valence electrons acquire sufficient energy to enter the conduction band and thus become free electrons. Under the influence of an electric field, these free electrons will constitute electric current. It may be noted that each time a valence electron enters into the conduction band, a hole is created in the valence band. As we shall see in the next article, holes also contribute to current. In fact, hole current is the most significant concept in semiconductors.


# 5.7 Hole Current

At room temperature, some of the covalent bonds in pure semiconductors break, setting up free electrons. Under the influence of an electric field, these free electrons constitute electric current. At the same time, another current—the hole current—also flows in the semiconductor. When a covalent bond is broken due to thermal energy, the removal of one electron leaves a vacancy, i.e., a missing electron in the covalent bond. This missing electron is called a “hole,” which acts as a positive charge. For one electron set free, one hole is created. Therefore, thermal energy creates hole-electron pairs; there being as many holes as the free electrons. The current conduction by holes can be explained as follows:

The hole shows a missing electron. Suppose the valence electron at location L becomes free due to thermal energy. This creates a hole in the covalent bond at L. The hole is a vacancy for the electron (say at M) from a nearby covalent bond to fill. This results in the creation of a hole at M. Another valence electron (say at N) may then move to fill the hole at M, thus creating a hole at N. Thus, the hole, having a positive charge, has moved from L to N, i.e., towards the negative terminal of the supply. This constitutes hole current.

It may be noted that hole current is due to the movement of valence electrons from one covalent bond to another bond. The reader may wonder why to call it a hole current when the conduction is again by electrons (of course valence electrons). The answer is that the basic reason for current flow is the presence of holes in the co-valent bonds. Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider the current as the movement of holes.

## Energy Band Description
The hole current can be beautifully explained in terms of energy bands. Suppose due to thermal energy, an electron leaves the valence band to enter into the conduction band, as shown in the energy band description.

This leaves a vacancy at L. Now the valence electron at M comes to fill the hole at L. The result is that the hole disappears at L and appears at M. Next, the valence electron at N moves into the hole at M. Consequently, the hole is created at N. It is clear that valence electrons move along the path PNM, whereas holes move in the opposite direction, i.e., along the path LMN.

**Note:** That hole acts as a virtual charge, although there is no physical charge on it. It is a strong tendency of semiconductor crystal to form co-valent bonds. Therefore, a hole attracts an electron from the neighboring atom. Unlike the normal current, which is by free electrons.


# 5.8 Intrinsic Semiconductor

An intrinsic semiconductor, even at room temperature, is an extremely pure form of semiconductor in which hole-electron pairs are created. The electric field is applied across an intrinsic semiconductor; the current conduction takes place by two processes, namely: by free electrons and holes, as shown in the energy band description. The free electrons are produced due to the breaking up of some covalent bonds by thermal energy. At the same time, holes are created in the covalent bonds. Under the influence of electric field, conduction through the semiconductor is by both free electrons and holes. Therefore, the total current inside the semiconductor is the sum of currents due to free electrons and holes.

It may be noted that the current in the external wires is electrically the same, i.e., by electrons. What about the holes? Referring to Fig. 5.10, holes, being positively charged, move towards the negative terminal of the supply. As holes reach the negative terminal, electrons from the negative terminal enter the semiconductor crystal and combine with holes, thus canceling them. At the same time, the loosely held electrons near the positive terminal are attracted away from their atoms into the positive terminal. This creates new holes near the positive terminal, which again drift towards the negative terminal.

# 5.9 Extrinsic Semiconductor

In intrinsic semiconductors, the pure semiconductor must be altered so as to significantly increase its conducting properties. This is achieved by adding a small amount of suitable impurity to a semiconductor. It is then called an *impurity* or *extrinsic semiconductor*. The process of adding impurities to a semiconductor during the preparation of the semiconductor is known as *doping*. The amount and type of such impurities have to be closely controlled.

The purpose of adding impurity is to increase either the number of free electrons or holes in the semiconductor crystal. As we shall see, if a pentavalent impurity (having 5 valence electrons) is added to the semiconductor, a large number of free electrons are produced in the semiconductor. On the other hand, addition of trivalent impurity (having 3 valence electrons) creates a large number of holes in the semiconductor. Depending upon the type of impurity added, extrinsic semiconductors are classified into:

(i) *n-type semiconductor*  
(ii) *p-type semiconductor*

# 5.10 n-type Semiconductor

When a small amount of pentavalent impurity is added to a pure semiconductor, it is known as an *n-type semiconductor*.

The addition of pentavalent impurity provides a large number of free electrons in the semiconductor crystal. Typical examples of pentavalent impurities are arsenic (At. No. 33) and antimony (At. No. 51). Such impurities, which produce n-type semiconductors, are known as donor impurities because they donate or provide free electrons to the semiconductor crystal.

To explain the formation of an n-type semiconductor, consider a pure germanium crystal. We know that a germanium atom has four valence electrons. When a small amount of pentavalent impurity like arsenic is added to germanium crystal, a large number of free electrons become available in the crystal. The reason is simple: Arsenic is pentavalent, i.e., its atom has five valence electrons. An arsenic atom fits in the germanium crystal in such a way that its four valence electrons form covalent bonds with four germanium atoms. The fifth valence electron of arsenic atom finds no place in co-valent bonds and is thus free, as shown in the crystal structure. Therefore, for each arsenic atom added, one free electron will be available in the germanium crystal. Though each arsenic atom provides one free electron, yet an extremely small amount of arsenic impurity provides enough atoms to supply millions of free electrons.

The energy band description of an n-type semiconductor shows that the addition of pentavalent impurity has produced a number of conduction band electrons, i.e., free electrons. The four valence electrons of pentavalent atom form covalent bonds with four neighboring germanium atoms. The fifth (free) valence electron of the pentavalent atom cannot be accommodated in the valence band and travels to the conduction band. The following points may be noted carefully:

(i) Many new free electrons are produced by the addition of pentavalent impurity.  
(ii) Thermal energy of room temperature still generates a few hole-electron pairs. However, the number of free electrons provided by the pentavalent impurity far exceeds the number of holes. It is due to this predominance of electrons over holes that it is called an n-type semiconductor (n stands for negative).

The current conduction in an n-type semiconductor is predominantly by free electrons, i.e., negative charges, and is called n-type or electron type conductivity. To understand n-type conductivity, refer to the description of current flow. When p.d. is applied across the n-type semiconductor, the free electrons (donated by impurity) in the crystal will be directed towards the positive terminal, constituting electric current. As the current flow through the crystal is by free electrons, which are carriers of negative charge, therefore, this type of conductivity is called negative or n-type conductivity. It may be noted that conduction is just as in ordinary metals like copper.


# 5.11 p-type Semiconductor

When a small amount of trivalent impurity is added to a pure semiconductor, it is called a *p-type semiconductor*.

The addition of trivalent impurity provides a large number of holes in the semiconductor crystal. Typical examples of trivalent impurities are gallium (At. No. 31) and indium (At. No. 49). Such impurities, which produce p-type semiconductors, are known as acceptor impurities because the holes created can accept the electrons.

To explain the formation of a p-type semiconductor, consider a pure germanium crystal. We know that a germanium atom has four valence electrons. When a small amount of trivalent impurity like gallium is added to germanium crystal, a large number of holes are created. The reason is simple: Gallium is trivalent, i.e., its atom has three valence electrons. Gallium fits into the germanium crystal, but now only three co-valent bonds can be formed, because gallium has only three valence electrons available. This creates a missing electron, known as a hole, in the crystal lattice. In the fourth co-valent bond, with three germanium atoms as shown in the crystal structure, germanium atoms contribute one valence electron, while gallium has no valence electrons to contribute, as all its three valence electrons are already engaged in the co-valent bonds. The resulting germanium atoms, in a single co-valent bond, with three germanium atoms, leave a missing electron, called a “hole.” Therefore, for each gallium atom added, one hole is created.

The energy band description of the p-type semiconductor shows that there are a few conduction band electrons due to thermal energy. However, the addition of trivalent impurity has shifted the acceptor level closer to the valence band. As a result, there are many more holes in the valence band than free electrons. It is due to the predominance of holes over free electrons that it is called a p-type semiconductor (p stands for positive).

The current conduction in a p-type semiconductor is predominantly by holes, i.e., positive charges, and is called p-type or hole-type conductivity. To understand p-type conductivity, consider the description of current flow. When p.d. is applied across the p-type semiconductor, the holes (donated by the trivalent impurity) are shifted from one co-valent bond to another. As the holes are positively charged, they are directed towards the negative terminal, constituting what is known as hole current. It may be noted that in p-type conductivity, the valence electrons move from one co-valent bond to another, unlike the n-type where current conduction is by free electrons.


# 5.12 Charge on n-type and p-type Semiconductors

As discussed before, in an n-type semiconductor, current conduction is due to excess of electrons, whereas in a p-type semiconductor, current conduction is due to holes. The reader may think that n-type material has a net negative charge and p-type a net positive charge. This conclusion is wrong. It is true that an n-type semiconductor has an excess of electrons, but these extra electrons were supplied by the atoms of donor impurity, and each atom of donor impurity is electrically neutral. When the impurity atom is added, the term “excess electrons” refers to an excess with regard to the number of electrons needed to fill the co-valent bonds in the semiconductor crystal. The extra electrons are free electrons and increase the conductivity of the semiconductor. The situation with regard to p-type semiconductor is also similar.

It follows, therefore, that n-type as well as p-type semiconductor is electrically neutral.

# 5.13 Majority and Minority Carriers

It has already been discussed that due to the effect of impurity, n-type material has a large number of free electrons, whereas p-type material has a large number of holes. However, it may be recalled that even at room temperature, some of the co-valent bonds break, thus releasing an equal number of free electrons and holes. An n-type material has its share of electron-hole pairs (released due to breaking of bonds at room temperature), but in addition, it has a much larger quantity of free electrons due to the effect of impurity. These impurity-caused free electrons are not associated with holes. Consequently, an n-type material has a large number of free electrons and a small number of holes, as shown in the description of current flow. The free electrons in this case are considered majority carriers—since the majority portion of current in an n-type material is by the flow of free electrons—and the holes are the minority carriers.

Similarly, in a p-type material, holes outnumber the free electrons as shown in the description. Therefore, holes are the majority carriers, and free electrons are the minority carriers.

# 5.14 p-n Junction

When a p-type semiconductor is suitably joined to an n-type semiconductor, the contact surface is called a *p-n junction*.

Most semiconductor devices contain one or more p-n junctions. The p-n junction is of great importance because it is in effect, the control element for semiconductor devices. A thorough knowledge of the formation and properties of p-n junction can enable the reader to understand the semiconductor devices.

Formation of p-n junction: In actual practice, the characteristic properties of p-n junction will not be apparent if a p-type block is just brought in contact with an n-type block. In fact, p-n junction is fabricated by special techniques. One common method of making p-n junction is called alloying. In this method, a small block of indium (trivalent impurity) is placed on an n-type germanium slab, as shown in the description of the process. The system is then heated at a temperature of about 500°C. The indium and some of the germanium melt to form a small puddle of molten germanium-indium mixture as shown in the description of the process. The temperature is then lowered, and puddle begins to solidify. Under proper conditions, the atoms of indium impurity will be suitably adjusted in the germanium slab to form a single crystal. The addition of indium overcomes the excess of electrons in the n-type germanium to such an extent that it creates a p-type region.

As the process goes on, the remaining molten mixture becomes increasingly rich in indium. When all germanium has been redeposited, the remaining material appears as indium button, which is frozen on to the outer surface of the crystallized portion, as shown in the description of the process. This button serves as a suitable base for soldering on leads.

# 5.16 Applying D.C. Voltage Across p-n Junction or Biasing

In electronics, the term "bias" refers to the use of d.c. voltage to establish certain operating conditions for an electronic device. In relation to a p-n junction, there are the following two bias conditions:

1. **Forward Biasing**  
2. **Reverse Biasing**

## 1. Forward Biasing
When external d.c. voltage is applied to the junction in such a direction that it cancels the potential barrier, thus permitting current flow, it is called forward biasing.

To apply forward bias, connect the positive terminal of the battery to p-type and negative terminal to n-type, as shown in the description of the process. The applied forward potential establishes an electric field which acts against the field due to potential barrier. Therefore, the resultant field is weakened, and the barrier height is reduced at the junction, as shown in the description. As potential barrier voltage is very small (0.1 to 0.3 V), therefore, a small forward voltage is sufficient to completely eliminate the barrier. Once the potential barrier is eliminated by the forward voltage, junction resistance becomes almost zero, and a low resistance path is established for the entire circuit. Therefore, current flows in the circuit. This is called *forward current*. With forward bias to p-n junction, the following points are worth noting:

(i) The potential barrier is reduced, and at some forward voltage (0.1 to 0.3 V), it is eliminated altogether.  
(ii) The junction offers low resistance (called *forward resistance, Rf*) to current flow.  
(iii) Current flows in the circuit due to the establishment of low resistance path. The magnitude of current depends upon the applied forward voltage.

## 2. Reverse Biasing
When the external d.c. voltage applied to the junction is in such a direction that it increases the potential barrier, it is called reverse biasing.

To apply reverse bias, connect the negative terminal of the battery to p-type and positive terminal to n-type, as shown in the description. It is clear that applied reverse voltage establishes an electric field which acts in the same direction as the field due to potential barrier. Therefore, the resultant field is strengthened, and the barrier height is increased, as shown in the description. The increased potential barrier prevents the flow of charge carriers across the junction. Thus, a high resistance path is established for the entire circuit, and hence current does not flow. With reverse bias to p-n junction, the following points are worth noting:

(i) The potential barrier is increased.  
(ii) The junction offers very high resistance (called *reverse resistance, Rr*) to current flow.  
(iii) No current flows in the circuit due to the establishment of high resistance path.

Conclusion: From the above discussion, it follows that with reverse bias to the junction, a high resistance path is established, and hence no current flows in the circuit. With forward bias, a low resistance path is set up in the junction, and hence current flows in the circuit.

# 5.17 Current Flow Across p-n Junction When Biased in Forward Direction

We shall now see how current flows across a p-n junction when it is forward biased. In forward bias on the junction, under the influence of forward voltage, the free electrons in n-type move towards the junction, leaving behind positively charged atoms. However, more electrons arrive from the negative battery terminal and enter the n-region to take up their places. As the free electrons reach the junction, they become “valence electrons.” As valence electrons, they move through the holes in the p-region. The valence electrons move towards the left in the p-region, which is equivalent to the holes moving to the right. When the valence electrons reach the left end of the crystal, they flow into the positive terminal of the battery.

The mechanism of current flow in a forward biased p-n junction can be summed up as under:

(i) The free electrons from the negative terminal continue to pour into the n-region, while the holes in the p-region move towards the junction.  
(ii) As these electrons reach the p-region, they combine with holes and become valence electrons.  
(iii) When these valence electrons reach the left end of the crystal, they flow into the positive terminal of the battery.

From the above discussion, it is concluded that in the n-type region, current is carried by free electrons, whereas in the p-type region, it is carried by holes. However, in the external connecting wires, the current is carried by free electrons.


# 5.18 Volt-Ampere Characteristics of a pn Junction

A pn junction, also called a crystal or semiconductor diode, is the curve between voltage across the junction and the circuit current. Usually, voltage is taken along the x-axis and current along the y-axis. The characteristics of a pn junction can be studied under three heads, namely: zero external voltage, forward bias, and reverse bias.

### (i) Zero External Voltage
When the external voltage is zero, i.e., the circuit is open at K, the potential barrier at the junction does not permit current flow. Therefore, the circuit current is zero as indicated by point O.

### (ii) Forward Bias
In forward bias, the positive terminal of the voltage source is connected to the p-side and the negative terminal to the n-side of the pn junction. This reduces the potential barrier, allowing current to flow easily. The current increases exponentially with the increase in forward voltage.

### (iii) Reverse Bias
In reverse bias, the positive terminal of the voltage source is connected to the n-side and the negative terminal to the p-side of the pn junction. This increases the potential barrier, preventing current flow. However, a small leakage current may flow due to minority charge carriers. If the reverse voltage exceeds a certain limit, it can lead to breakdown, causing a sudden increase in current.

R is the current limiting resistance. It prevents the forward current from exceeding the permitted value.

## Description of the Circuit

The circuit diagram shows a pn junction diode connected in a circuit. The diode is represented by a triangle pointing towards a line, symbolizing the p-side and n-side of the junction. The circuit includes a voltage source (V) connected across the diode, with a current limiting resistor (R) in series. A milliammeter (mA) is placed in the circuit to measure the current flowing through the diode, and a voltmeter (V) is connected across the diode to measure the voltage. The circuit can be configured for zero external voltage, forward bias, or reverse bias by adjusting the connections of the voltage source.

## Description of the Graph

The graph plots the relationship between voltage (V) on the x-axis and current (I) on the y-axis for a pn junction diode. 

- **X-Axis (Voltage, V in Volts):** The horizontal axis represents the voltage across the pn junction, ranging from negative values (reverse bias) to positive values (forward bias). It includes markings such as -15, -10, -5, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, and beyond, indicating the voltage levels in both forward and reverse directions.
  
- **Y-Axis (Current, I in mA):** The vertical axis represents the current flowing through the diode, measured in milliamperes (mA). It ranges from 0 to 400 mA, with markings at 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400, showing the current levels.

- **Curve Characteristics:**
  - Starting from the origin (point O, where both voltage and current are zero), the curve remains flat and close to the x-axis for negative voltages (reverse bias), indicating very little or no current flow due to the potential barrier. This region is labeled "BARRIER VOLTAGE."
  - As the voltage becomes slightly positive (forward bias, around 0.1 to 0.5 V), the curve rises steeply, showing an exponential increase in current, indicating that the potential barrier is overcome, and current flows easily.
  - In the reverse bias region (negative voltages), there is a small leakage current, but if the voltage becomes highly negative, the curve shows a sharp vertical rise at a point labeled "BREAKDOWN," indicating a sudden increase in current due to breakdown of the junction.
  - The curve has two key points labeled A and B: Point A is in the forward bias region where current starts increasing significantly, and point B is in the reverse bias region, possibly indicating the onset of breakdown or a critical point in reverse bias.

- **Additional Labels:**
  - "BARRIER VOLTAGE" is marked near the origin, highlighting the region where the potential barrier prevents current flow.
  - "BREAKDOWN" is labeled on the curve in the reverse bias region, indicating the point where the diode fails, and current surges.

The graph visually represents how the pn junction behaves under different bias conditions, showing the diode's non-linear characteristic with distinct forward and reverse bias regions.


# 7.1 Zener Diode

A Zener diode is a specially designed diode that operates in the reverse breakdown region without damage, due to heavy doping that creates a thin depletion layer and a sharp breakdown voltage, Vz. This is evident in its reverse characteristic, where:

(i) The diode current increases rapidly at Vz.
(ii) The reverse voltage Vz across the diode remains nearly constant, allowing the Zener diode to function as a voltage regulator.

### Circuit Description
The circuit includes a Zener diode in reverse bias, connected across a voltage source with a series resistor to limit current. The diode’s cathode (n-side) connects to the positive terminal, and the anode (p-side) to the negative terminal, maintaining a stable voltage (Vz) across a parallel load despite input or load variations.

### Graph Description
The graph plots voltage (V) on the x-axis and current (I) on the y-axis, focusing on reverse bias:

- **X-Axis (Voltage, V):** Shows negative values, with Vz marking the breakdown voltage.
- **Y-Axis (Current, I):** Ranges from zero to high values, showing a sharp current increase.
- **Curve Characteristics:** Flat at low reverse voltages, then drops vertically at Vz, indicating breakdown. Post-breakdown, voltage stays constant at Vz as current rises, labeled "ZENER BREAKDOWN REGION."

The graph highlights the Zener diode’s ability to maintain a stable voltage in breakdown, ideal for voltage regulation.

# 7.2 Light-Emitting Diode (LED)

A light-emitting diode (LED) is a diode that gives off visible light when forward biased. Unlike germanium and silicon diodes, LEDs are made using elements like gallium, phosphorus, and arsenic. By varying the quantities of these elements, it is possible to produce light of different wavelengths with colors such as red, green, yellow, and blue. For example, when a LED is manufactured using gallium arsenide, it will produce a red light. If using gallium phosphide, it will produce a green light.

### Theory
When light-emitting diode (LED) is forward biased, as shown in the schematic, the electrons from the n-type material cross the pn junction and recombine with holes in the p-type material. Recall that these free electrons are at a higher energy level than the holes in the valence band. When recombination takes place, the excess energy is given up in the form of heat and emitted light. In germanium and silicon diodes, the emitted light energy is insignificant. However, in intense gallium arsenide, the number of photons of light energy is sufficient to produce quite intense visible light.

### Circuit Description
The circuit diagram shows an LED in forward bias, with the positive terminal of the voltage source connected to the p-side (anode) and the negative terminal to the n-side (cathode) of the diode. Arrows in the diagram indicate light emission from the device when forward biased. The LED is typically connected in series with a current-limiting resistor to prevent excessive current that could damage the diode. The schematic symbol includes arrows pointing away from the diode, representing light emission.

### Graph Description
The graph plots current (I) on the x-axis and radiated light intensity on the y-axis for an LED:

- **X-Axis (Current, I in mA):** The horizontal axis represents the forward current through the LED, ranging from 0 to 100 mA, with markings at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100, indicating the current levels.
- **Y-Axis (Radiated Light Intensity):** The vertical axis represents the intensity of light emitted by the LED, with arbitrary units (not specified) ranging from 0 to 12, showing the light output levels.
- **Curve Characteristics:** The curve starts at the origin (0,0) and rises steeply as the current increases, indicating that the light intensity increases exponentially with forward current. The graph demonstrates a direct relationship between the forward current and the brightness of the emitted light, which is clear and intense from the diode.

The graph and circuit highlight the LED’s ability to emit visible light efficiently when forward biased, making it useful in applications requiring illumination or indicators.


# 7.3 LED Voltage and Current

The forward voltage ratings of most LEDs range from 1V to 3V, and forward current ratings range from 20 mA to 100 mA. In order for the LED to operate safely, a series resistor, Rs, is connected in series with it, as shown in the circuit. The input voltage is Vs, and the voltage across LED is VD.

### Formula
Voltage across Rs = Vs - VD

### Circuit Description
The circuit diagram shows an LED connected in series with a current-limiting resistor (Rs) to a power supply (Vs). The positive terminal of the power supply is connected to the anode (p-side) of the LED, and the cathode (n-side) of the LED is connected to one end of the resistor, with the other end of the resistor tied to the negative terminal of the power supply. The LED forward voltage (VD) and the resistor ensure the forward current (IF) stays within safe limits, typically 20 mA to 100 mA, preventing damage to the LED.

### Examples and Calculations

#### Example 7.1
What value of series resistor, Rs, is required to limit the current through an LED to 20 mA with a forward voltage drop of 1.6 V when connected to a 10 V supply?

- Given: Vs = 10 V, VD = 1.6 V, IF = 20 mA = 20 × 10⁻³ A
- Formula: Rs = (Vs - VD) / IF
- Solution: Rs = (10 - 1.6) / (20 × 10⁻³) = 8.4 / 0.02 = 420 Ω

#### Example 7.2
What is the current through the LED in the circuit shown, assuming a voltage drop across the LED is 2 V?

- Given: Vs = 15 V, VD = 2 V, Rs = 2.2 kΩ = 2.2 × 10³ Ω
- Formula: IF = (Vs - VD) / Rs
- Solution: IF = (15 - 2) / (2.2 × 10³) = 13 / 2200 = 5.91 × 10⁻³ A = 5.91 mA

### Additional Note
The resistor Rs is also called the current-limiting resistor, ensuring the LED operates safely within its forward current rating, as illustrated in the circuit diagram.

# 7.4 Advantages of LED

The light-emitting diode (LED) is a solid-state light source. LEDs have replaced incandescent lamps in many applications because they have the following advantages:

(i) Long life (more than 20 years)
(ii) Fast on-off switching

### Protecting LED Against Reverse Bias
LEDs have low reverse voltage ratings. For example, a typical LED may have a maximum reverse voltage rating of 5 V. This means that if a reverse voltage greater than 5 V is applied to the LED, it may be destroyed. Therefore, one must be careful not to use the LED with a level of reverse bias. One way to protect an LED is to connect a rectifier diode in parallel with the LED, as shown in the circuit. If a reverse voltage is accidentally applied, the rectifier diode will turn on. This protects the LED from damage because the reverse voltage rating of LED is accidentally applied, the rectifier diode will turn on. This protects the LED from damage because the reverse voltage rating of the LED is lower than that of the rectifier diode.

### Circuit Description
The circuit diagram shows an LED connected in parallel with a rectifier diode, in series with a 100 Ω resistor and a 5 V power supply. The positive terminal of the power supply is connected to the anode of the LED and the cathode of the rectifier diode, while the negative terminal is connected to the other end of the resistor. The LED’s anode is tied to the cathode of the rectifier diode, and the LED’s cathode is connected to the anode of the rectifier diode. This configuration ensures that if a reverse voltage is applied, the rectifier diode conducts, protecting the LED from damage due to its low reverse voltage rating (typically 5 V or less). The resistor limits the current to prevent damage to both the LED and the rectifier diode during normal forward bias operation.

# 7.5 Multicolour LEDs

An LED that emits one color when forward biased and another color when reverse biased is called a multicolour LED. One commonly used schematic symbol for these LEDs is shown in the diagrams.

### Theory
Multicolour LEDs actually contain two pn junctions that are connected in reverse-parallel (i.e., the anode of one being connected to the cathode of the other). If positive potential is applied to the top terminal, as shown in Fig. 7.7(i), the pn junction on the left will light. Note that the direction of the device current has passed through the left pn junction. If the polarity of the voltage source is reversed, as shown in Fig. 7.7(ii), the pn junction on the right will light. Note that the direction of the device current has passed through the right pn junction.

Multicolour LEDs are typically red and green. When biased in one direction and green when biased in the other. If a multicolour LED is switched fast enough between two polarities, the LED will produce a third colour. A red-green LED, when rapidly switched back and forth between biasing polarities, will produce a yellow light.

### Circuit Description
The circuit diagrams show a multicolour LED with two pn junctions connected in reverse-parallel, in series with a current-limiting resistor (Rs) and a voltage source. In Fig. 7.7(i), the positive terminal of the voltage source is connected to the top terminal (anode of the left junction and cathode of the right junction), and the negative terminal is connected to the bottom terminal (cathode of the left junction and anode of the right junction), causing the left pn junction to emit light (e.g., red). In Fig. 7.7(ii), the polarity is reversed, with the positive terminal connected to the bottom terminal and the negative terminal to the top terminal, causing the right pn junction to emit light (e.g., green). Arrows in the diagrams indicate light emission from the respective junctions when forward biased. The resistor Rs limits the current to prevent damage to the LED during operation in either direction. Rapid switching of the voltage polarity can produce a yellow light by alternating between red and green emissions.

# 7.6 Applications of LEDs

The LED is a low-power device. The power rating of an LED is of the order of milliwatts, making it useful as an indicator but not good for illumination. Probably the two most common applications for visible LEDs are (i) as a power indicator and (ii) seven-segment display.

### (i) As a Power Indicator
A LED can be used to indicate whether the power is on or not. When the switch is closed, power is applied to the LED. At the same time, current also flows through the LED, which lights, indicating power is on. The resistor Rs, in series with the LED, ensures that current rating of the LED is not exceeded.

### Circuit Description
The circuit diagram shows an LED connected in series with a current-limiting resistor (Rs) to a power supply (Vs). The positive terminal of the power supply is connected to one end of the resistor, and the other end of the resistor is connected to the anode (p-side) of the LED. The cathode (n-side) of the LED is connected to the negative terminal (ground) of the power supply. When the switch is closed, current flows through the circuit, lighting the LED to indicate that power is on. The resistor Rs limits the current to keep it within the safe operating range of the LED (typically 20 mA to 100 mA), preventing damage.

### (ii) Seven-Segment Display
LEDs are often grouped to form seven-segment displays, as shown in the diagram. Each LED is called a “segment” because it forms part of the character being displayed. In a seven-segment LED (A, B, C, D, E, F, and G), if a particular LED is forward biased, it will light, and the display will show the corresponding number or letter. For example, to display the number 0, all segments except G are lit.

### Circuit Description
The circuit diagram shows a seven-segment display consisting of seven LEDs (labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G) arranged in a figure-eight pattern, connected to a common positive voltage source of +5 V. This arrangement is known as “common-anode type.” Each LED segment has its anode connected to the +5 V supply, and its cathode is connected to a ground point through a current-limiting resistor. To light a particular LED, say A, we ground the point A in the diagram. This forward biases the LED A, causing it to light. The resistors ensure that currents are kept safe. Note that LEDs A, B, C, D, and E are arranged clockwise from the top, with LED G in the middle and F at the bottom. To display the number 0, all segments (A, B, C, D, E, and F) are lit by grounding their respective points, while G remains unlit.

# 7.7 Photo-diode

A photo-diode is a reverse-biased silicon or germanium pn junction in which reverse current decreases when the junction is exposed to light.

### Theory
The reverse current in a photo-diode is directly proportional to the intensity of light falling on its pn junction. This means that the greater the intensity of light falling on the pn junction of the photo-diode, the greater will be the reverse current.

When a rectifier diode is reverse biased, it has a very small reverse leakage current due to thermally generated electron-hole pairs, which are swept across the junction by the electric field created by the reverse voltage. In a photo-diode, the reverse current increases with the increase in light intensity and vice-versa. This is explained as follows: When light (photons) falls on the pn junction, the energy is imparted by the photons to the atoms in the junction. This will create more free electrons (and holes). These additional free electrons will increase the reverse current. As the intensity of light incident on the pn junction increases, the reverse current also increases. In other words, as the incident light intensity increases, the resistance of the device (photo-diode) decreases.

### Circuit Description
The circuit diagram is not explicitly shown, but a typical photo-diode setup involves a reverse-biased pn junction connected to a voltage source. The positive terminal of the voltage source is connected to the cathode (n-side) of the photo-diode, and the negative terminal is connected to the anode (p-side), creating a reverse bias. The photo-diode package includes a window on top of the case to allow light to enter and strike the pn junction. Two leads extend from the case, labeled anode and cathode, with the cathode typically identified by a tab extending from the side of the case. The photo-diode is mounted on an insulated substrate and sealed inside a metal case. A glass window mounted on the case allows incoming light to reach the pn junction, enabling the device to detect light intensity changes and adjust the reverse current accordingly.

### Graph Description
The graph is not provided, but based on the theory, it would plot light intensity on the x-axis and reverse current on the y-axis for a photo-diode:

- **X-Axis (Light Intensity):** The horizontal axis represents the intensity of light incident on the pn junction, ranging from low to high levels, indicating varying light exposure.
- **Y-Axis (Reverse Current):** The vertical axis represents the reverse current flowing through the photo-diode, measured in microamperes (µA) or milliamperes (mA), showing an increase as light intensity increases.
- **Curve Characteristics:** The curve starts at a low reverse current (due to thermal leakage) when light intensity is minimal and rises steeply as light intensity increases. The relationship is nearly linear, showing that higher light intensity results in proportionally higher reverse current, reflecting the photo-diode’s sensitivity to light.

The graph would illustrate how the photo-diode’s reverse current varies directly with light intensity, making it useful for light-detection applications.

# 7.8 Photo-diode Operation

This section explains the basic operation of a photo-diode circuit, which has a reverse-biased photo-diode, resistor R, and a d.c. supply.

### Theory
(i) When no light is incident on the pn junction of the photo-diode, the reverse current, I_R, is extremely small. This is called dark current.
The resistance of the photo-diode with no incident light is called dark resistance (R_d).

Dark resistance of photo-diode, R_d = V_R / I_R

(ii) When light is incident on the pn junction of the photo-diode, the energy from the incident light (photons) is transferred to the atoms in the junction. This will create more free electrons (and more holes). These additional free electrons will increase the reverse current.
(iii) As the intensity of light increases, the reverse current also increases and becomes maximum. This is called saturation current.

### Circuit Description
The circuit diagram shows a reverse-biased photo-diode connected in series with a resistor (R) to a d.c. voltage supply (V_R). The positive terminal of the voltage supply is connected to the cathode (n-side) of the photo-diode, and the negative terminal is connected to one end of the resistor, with the other end of the resistor tied to the anode (p-side) of the photo-diode. This configuration creates a reverse bias across the photo-diode. The resistor limits the current and allows measurement of the voltage drop, which varies with the light intensity incident on the photo-diode. The photo-diode package includes a window to allow light to strike the pn junction, enabling the device to detect light and adjust the reverse current accordingly.

# 7.9 Characteristics of Photo-diode

There are two important characteristics of a photo-diode:

(i) Reverse current-illumination curve.
Fig. 7.12 shows the graph between reverse current (I_R) and illumination (E) of a photo-diode. The reverse current is shown on the vertical axis and is measured in µA. The illumination is indicated on the horizontal axis and is measured in mW/cm². Note that the graph is a straight line passing through the origin, where I_R = mE.

The quantity m is called the sensitivity of the photo-diode.

(ii) Reverse current-reverse voltage curve.
Fig. 7.13 shows the graph between reverse current (I_R) and reverse voltage (V_R) for various levels of illumination. It is clear that for a given illumination, the reverse current increases as the illumination on the pn junction of the photo-diode is increased.

### Graph Descriptions

#### (i) Reverse Current-Illumination Curve
The graph plots illumination (E) on the x-axis and reverse current (I_R) on the y-axis for a photo-diode:

- **X-Axis (Illumination, E in mW/cm²):** The horizontal axis represents the illumination level incident on the photo-diode, ranging from 0 to 10 mW/cm², with markings at 5 and 10, indicating the light intensity.
- **Y-Axis (Reverse Current, I_R in µA):** The vertical axis represents the reverse current flowing through the photo-diode, measured in microamperes (µA), ranging from 0 to 100 µA, with markings at 30 and 100, showing the current levels.
- **Curve Characteristics:** The curve is a straight line passing through the origin (0,0), indicating a linear relationship where I_R = mE. The slope m represents the sensitivity of the photo-diode, showing that reverse current increases proportionally with illumination. The graph demonstrates how higher light intensity results in higher reverse current, reflecting the photo-diode’s light-detection capability.

#### (ii) Reverse Current-Reverse Voltage Curve
The graph plots reverse voltage (V_R) on the x-axis and reverse current (I_R) on the y-axis for a photo-diode under various illumination levels:

- **X-Axis (Reverse Voltage, V_R in Volts):** The horizontal axis represents the reverse voltage applied across the photo-diode, ranging from 0 to a higher value (not fully specified), with markings at 0, indicating the voltage levels.
- **Y-Axis (Reverse Current, I_R in µA):** The vertical axis represents the reverse current flowing through the photo-diode, measured in microamperes (µA), ranging from 0 to a higher value (e.g., up to 600 µA), with multiple curves for different illumination levels (e.g., E = 600 lux, E = 400 lux, E = 200 lux, and dark current).
- **Curve Characteristics:** Multiple curves are shown, each corresponding to a different illumination level. For a given illumination, the reverse current remains relatively constant or increases slightly with increasing reverse voltage, but the key distinction is that higher illumination levels (e.g., 600 lux) result in higher reverse currents compared to lower levels (e.g., 200 lux) or dark conditions (no light). The curves start near the origin and rise gradually, with the dark current (no illumination) showing the lowest current. As illumination increases, the curves shift upward, demonstrating that reverse current increases with light intensity, even at the same reverse voltage.

These graphs highlight the photo-diode’s sensitivity to light, showing how reverse current varies with both illumination and reverse voltage, making it useful for light-sensing applications.

# 7.10 Applications of Photo-diodes

There are a large number of applications of photo-diodes. However, we shall give two applications of photo-diodes:

(i) Alarm circuit using photo-diode.
Fig. 7.14 shows the use of a photo-diode in an alarm system. Light from a light source is allowed to fall on a photo-diode detector in the doorway. The reverse current, I_R, will continue to flow so long as the light beam is not broken. If a person passes through the door, the light beam is broken, and the reverse current drops to the dark current level. As a result, an alarm is sounded.

(ii) Counter circuit using photo-diode.
Fig. 7.15 shows a photo-diode circuit used in a system that counts objects as they pass by on a conveyor. In this circuit, a source of light sends a concentrated beam of light across a conveyor to a photo-diode. As the object passes, the light beam is broken, I_R drops to the dark current level, and the count is increased by one.

### Examples and Calculations

#### Example 7.3
From the reverse current-illumination curve for a photo-diode shown in Fig. 7.16, determine the dark resistance. Assume a reverse-biased voltage of 10 V.

- Given: Reverse voltage, V_R = 10 V
- From the curve, dark current, I_R = 50 µA = 50 × 10⁻⁶ A (when illumination is 0 lux)
- Formula: Dark resistance, R_d = V_R / I_R
- Solution: R_d = 10 / (50 × 10⁻⁶) = 10 / 0.00005 = 200 × 10³ Ω = 200 kΩ

#### Example 7.4
For a photo-diode exposed to an illumination of 2.5 mW/cm², find the reverse current through the device if the sensitivity is 37.4 µA/mW/cm².

- Given: Illumination, E = 2.5 mW/cm², Sensitivity, m = 37.4 µA/mW/cm²
- Formula: Reverse current, I_R = m × E
- Solution: I_R = 37.4 × 2.5 = 93.5 µA

### Circuit Descriptions

#### (i) Alarm Circuit Using Photo-diode
The circuit diagram shows a photo-diode connected in a reverse-biased configuration with a light source and an alarm system. The photo-diode’s cathode is connected to the positive terminal of a voltage supply, and its anode is connected to ground through a resistor or detection circuit. A light source emits a beam directed at the photo-diode, positioned in a doorway. When the light beam is uninterrupted, the photo-diode conducts reverse current due to the incident light, keeping the alarm off. If the beam is broken (e.g., by a person passing through), the reverse current drops to the dark current level, triggering the alarm via a connected circuit.

#### (ii) Counter Circuit Using Photo-diode
The circuit diagram shows a photo-diode positioned opposite a light source across a conveyor belt, connected to a counter system. The photo-diode is reverse-biased, with its cathode tied to the positive terminal of a voltage supply and its anode connected to ground through a resistor or counter circuit. The light source emits a beam that strikes the photo-diode, maintaining a higher reverse current due to illumination. When an object on the conveyor interrupts the beam, the light is blocked, and the reverse current drops to the dark current level. This change is detected by the circuit, incrementing the counter by one.
