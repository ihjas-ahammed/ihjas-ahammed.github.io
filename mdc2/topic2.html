            <h3>Welcome, Sequence Seeker!</h3>
            <p>Your challenge is to decipher the patterns hidden within sequences of numbers or letters. Here are common types you might encounter:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arithmetic Progression:</strong> Each term is found by adding a constant difference (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8... difference is +2).</li>
                <li><strong>Geometric Progression:</strong> Each term is found by multiplying by a constant ratio (e.g., 3, 6, 12, 24... ratio is x2).</li>
                <li><strong>Square/Cube Series:</strong> Numbers are squares (1, 4, 9, 16...) or cubes (1, 8, 27, 64...) of integers.</li>
                <li><strong>Fibonacci Sequence:</strong> Each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (e.g., 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...).</li>
                <li><strong>Alternating Series:</strong> Two or more patterns interwoven (e.g., 1, 10, 2, 20, 3, 30...).</li>
                <li><strong>Difference/Sum Series:</strong> The difference or sum between consecutive terms forms its own pattern.</li>
                <li><strong>Letter Sequences:</strong> Often based on position in the alphabet, skipping letters, or related words (days, months).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Observe carefully, test different possibilities, and find the logic. Good luck!</p>

            { id: 1, questionText: "1, 4, 9, 19, 34, ?", options: ["79", "74", "89", "83"], correctOptionIndex: 0, explanation: "The difference between terms increases: +3, +5, +10, +15. This doesn't seem simple. Let's try another approach. Maybe difference of differences? Differences: 3, 5, 10, 15. Differences of differences: 2, 5, 5. Still not clear. Let's rethink. 1*2+2=4, 4*2+1=9, 9*2+1=19, 19*2-4=34... No. Let's try: 4 = 1*1 + 3, 9 = 4*1 + 5, 19 = 9*1 + 10, 34 = 19*1 + 15. The added numbers are 3, 5, 10, 15. The differences here are 2, 5, 5. This is tricky. Let's re-examine the image options. The provided answer is A (79). Let's work backward or try a complex pattern. Maybe 1*2+2=4, 4*2+1=9, 9*2+1=19, 19*2+(-4)=34, 34*2+11=79? The added/subtracted part (2, 1, 1, -4, 11) doesn't have an obvious pattern. Let's try differences again: 3, 5, 10, 15. The next difference could be based on the sum of the previous two differences? 5+10=15, 10+15=25? Then 34+25 = 59. Not an option. How about: 3, 5 (+2), 10 (+5), 15 (+5), maybe 25 (+10)? 34+25 = 59. Still not 79. Let's assume the answer 79 is correct and see if a pattern fits: Differences are 3, 5, 10, 15, 45. Differences of differences: 2, 5, 5, 30. No obvious pattern. *This question seems flawed or uses a very obscure pattern based on the options.* Let's assume a possible typo in the question or options, or a complex relation. However, if forced to find a pattern for 79: perhaps the pattern is adding primes starting from 3, then adding multiples of 5? +3, +5, +10 (5*2), +15 (5*3), +45 (next number needed)? No. Let's assume a pattern like x2 + n: 1*2+2=4, 4*2+1=9, 9*2+1=19, 19*2-4=34, 34*2+11=79. Pattern for n: +2, +1, +1, -4, +11. This lacks clarity. Let's try differences of terms added: +3, +5, +10, +15, +?. Look at 1, 4, 9, 19, 34, 79. Differences: 3, 5, 10, 15, 45. The relationship might be more complex, perhaps involving previous terms. 9=4+5, 19=9+10, 34=19+15, 79=34+45. The added numbers are 5, 10, 15, 45. Pattern: +5, +5, +30. Not consistent. **Given the provided options, and the common types of sequences, this question is ambiguous or potentially flawed.

Let's re-evaluate 3rd letters: B(2), D(4), G(7), I(9). Differences are +2, +3, +2. What if the pattern is +2, +3 repeated? Then next should be +3. I(9) + 3 = 12 (L). So the group is QOL." },

If the pattern /2, /? continues? Maybe /2, /4, /8? 128/2=64. 64/4=16. 16/8=2. So S3 might be 128, 64, 16, 2.
